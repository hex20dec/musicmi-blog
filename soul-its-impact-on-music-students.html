A lot of media outlets I'm reading from are proposing that it is one of the greatest Pixar movies of all times and I couldn't agree more. Just the beautiful classic Pixar animation style alongside the superb voice acting and emotional rollercoaster that Pixar movies tend to be; it was a reminder of just how great Pixar movies can be. I'd argue to say that it was the best one since <i>Coco</i>, which definitely made me shed tears. In regards to the thing that most stuck out to me about the film was the lesson to be learned at the end of the movie in the context of music, and that's really what I want to talk about today.</div><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xOsLIiBStEs?start=14" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><p>For those of your who haven't seen <i>Soul </i>yet... what are you waiting for? It was released to Disney Plus back in December 2020 so you've had ample time to check it out. I highly recommend it so please do check it out if you do have the time, it'll be worth it. Anyways, I'll give a short synopsis of the film. </p><p>The film takes us into the life of Joe Gardner, a middle school band teacher who's been waiting for his big break to become a professional musician. One day, he finally gets the chance to do so when he books a performance with a jazz legend. However, unfortunately for him, he suffers a sudden near-death traumatic experience that lands him in a coma in a hospital. Whilst in a coma, he ends up in a realm where unborn souls are meant to find their will to live, which is referred to as a "spark" in the film and therein would be awarded a badge that would send them to Earth. Joe's soul is mistaken for a mentor soul and is assigned to help a soul named 22 find her spark. 22 has no interest in becoming human, thus agrees to find her spark with Joe just to give it to him so that he may return to his body. They fail to find 22 a passion and discover a shortcut route to getting back to Earth, but upon coming back, Joe accidentally brings 22 with him. When transported back, 22 ends up in Joe's body while Joe ends up in a therapy cat. During this short time, 22 in Joe's body experiences a typical day in the life; eating pizza, talking to fellow people, and<br>listening to music. A superior from the prior realm discovers that they went missing and unaccounted for and goes in search for them, eventually finding them. When they are brought back to that realm, 22's badge is apparently filled out due to the experiences she had while in Joe's body. Joe brushes it off as those minute experiences as being irrelevant and adamantly states 22 never found her spark. 22 tosses her badge at Joe and angrily runs off while Joe uses the badge to get back to Earth in time for his performance. Joe does have a great performance, but for some reason he is left unsatisfied. He then begins to realize that 22's spark was fulfilled by the little moments she was able to enjoy and that he's been living his life wrong this entire time. He plays the piano to end back into that realm to find 22, convince her that he was wrong and that she was ready to live, gives her back her badge and sends her down to Earth. Joe, at that point, is ready to move onto the great beyond as he has no way to getting back to Earth, but is offered a second chance. Joe graciously accepts it and vows to live everyday to the fullest.</p><p> </p><p>I tried my best to keep the synopsis as short as possible, though with movie such as this one that has so many movie parts and different scenes, it was surely a difficult task. Regardless, let's talk about what the movie meant to music students. I think it was perfect that the main character was one that was very much involved in music and looking for a chance to breakthrough. As many people know, the music industry is one of the toughest industries to succeed in. It's a combination of talent, connections, resources and sometimes just being in the right place at the right time. I have a few friends who are currently studying music, whether it be composition or performance, and they all repeat the same sentiment that pursuing music is a difficult choice in it of itself. And many people who end up like Joe, stuck in a job that is able to provide him financial security but still wanting to do more with his passion. In the movie, Joe really only had one thing motivating him in life, and it was the prospect of one day making it onto a stage and becoming a famous musician. Though, that was his folly in the end. He realized that he wasn't as satisfied with the reality once it actually happened to him, and why is that? It's because his vision had been so clouded and he'd become too complacent with his own life that even one of his greatest experiences has only left him with so much happiness. I think that Joe's growth as a character is really a testament to what it really means to live in the moment and appreciate the little things. </p><p>This is certainly a refreshing lesson for those pursing a music career to hear, because a lot of times, they are also waiting for that big opportunity to happen but all that while, lose sight of the little things that bring joy as well. In fact, it could be the little things that continue to motivate people. I also believe that part of the lesson is to not be complacent as well and to take necessary risks to forward your career. For many of those pursing music, the risk is already choosing to pursue music. Many of my friends who are pursing music and watched the movie have said the same things how watching the movie has such a profound impact on them because it reminded them why they decided to make music their career in the first place and they really resonate with Joe and his life decisions. The film reminded them of the realities of trying to make it in the music industry but also encouraged them to take their careers by the horns and run with it, all whilst taking advantage of the little things that'll happen along the way. And the lesson couldn't come at a better time when musicians were thrown the biggest curveball in the shape of this current pandemic. It's no surprise that musicians have been heavily impacted by the pandemic and they've needed to power through if they want to continue their careers in music. <i>Soul</i> reminded them what is really is that motivates them to power forwards through all the turmoil. I had a friend who was continuing to pursue her dream of becoming a broadway actor, even throughout the pandemic, spending countless hours in class and working on her craft, even when all of her applications for potential roles have been withdrawn due to the pandemic. Her perseverance has really inspired me and I too, have been trying to figure out the best way to put myself out there as a musician in there trying times. </p><p><i>Soul</i> was a movie that's outreach is unlimited and can teach a lessons to people of all different background and age groups. The very fact that it was embedded in the story of a music professional has made its impact even more profound on those working in music. Thank you Pixar for producing another gem, we'll really be holding onto this one.</p><p>Also can we talk about the score for this movie? Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails as well as Jon Batiste did a tremendous job and it wouldn't be a stretch to say that they're influence on the film could have certainly had an impact on audience members as well.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 31, 2023</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://articles.musicmi.org/tags/disney/">disney</a></li><li><a href="https://articles.musicmi.org/tags/jazz/">jazz</a></li><li><a href="https://articles.musicmi.org/tags/jazz-vocal/">jazz vocal</a></li><li><a href="https://articles.musicmi.org/tags/music-technology/">music technology</a></li><li><a href="https://articles.musicmi.org/tags/musical-instruments/">musical instruments</a></li><li><a href="https://articles.musicmi.org/tags/pixar/">pixar</a></li><li><a href="https://articles.musicmi.org/tags/soul/">soul</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Farticles.musicmi.org%2Fsoul-its-impact-on-music-students.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://articles.musicmi.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Farticles.musicmi.org%2Fsoul-its-impact-on-music-students.html&amp;via=MusicMi%20News&amp;text=SOUL%3A%20ITS%20IMPACT%20ON%20MUSIC%20STUDENTS" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://articles.musicmi.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farticles.musicmi.org%2Fsoul-its-impact-on-music-students.html&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Farticles.musicmi.org%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F21%2F1024px-Logo_Soul.png&amp;description=SOUL%3A%20ITS%20IMPACT%20ON%20MUSIC%20STUDENTS" class="js-share pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://articles.musicmi.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> <span>Pinterest</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farticles.musicmi.org%2Fsoul-its-impact-on-music-students.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://articles.musicmi.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=SOUL%3A%20ITS%20IMPACT%20ON%20MUSIC%20STUDENTS https%3A%2F%2Farticles.musicmi.org%2Fsoul-its-impact-on-music-students.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://articles.musicmi.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><img src="https://articles.musicmi.org/media/website/Talia-V.jpeg" loading="lazy" height="1024" width="1024" class="bio__avatar" alt="Sofia M."><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://articles.musicmi.org/authors/sofia/" rel="author">Sofia M.</a></h3><p>Sofia is a talented writer who combines her background in music and writing to create engaging content.
