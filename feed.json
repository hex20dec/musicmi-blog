By the early 18th century enthusiasm in Western Europe for coffee amongst the middle classes had spread and was beginning to affect Prussia's economy. Frederick the Great, the country's monarch, attempted to block imports of green coffee as Prussia's wealth was being drained by this new craze. He restricted the right to sell coffee to four distillers but the coffee drinking trend has become so widespread that the law was being overlooked and coffee beans were illegally roasted all over the country.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><figure class=\"post__image align-left\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/37/pexels-pixabay-161039.jpeg\" alt=\"small austrian village\" width=\"545\" height=\"365\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/37/responsive/pexels-pixabay-161039-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/37/responsive/pexels-pixabay-161039-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/37/responsive/pexels-pixabay-161039-md.jpeg 768w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/37/responsive/pexels-pixabay-161039-lg.jpeg 1024w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/37/responsive/pexels-pixabay-161039-xl.jpeg 1360w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/37/responsive/pexels-pixabay-161039-2xl.jpeg 1600w\"></figure></div>\n<div class=\"inner\"><br>The Prussian king condemned the increase in coffee consumption as \"disgusting\" and urged his subjects to drink beer instead. The King even employed <em>coffee smellers</em>, who stalked the streets sniffing for the outlawed smell of fresh roasted coffee beans. However the public was so upset by this whole situation that eventually he was forced to change his mind.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div class=\"inner\">As a satire on this whole affair, Bach wrote the \"Coffee Cantata,\" a humorous one act operetta about a stern father's attempt to check his daughter's indulgence in the much loved Saxon habit of coffee drinking.</div>\n<p>\"If I couldn't three times a day, be allowed to drink my little cup of coffee, in my anguish, I will turn into a shriveled-up roast goat. ... Ah! How sweet coffee tastes, more delicious than a thousand kisses, milder than muscatel wine.\" Is the start to Bach's Schweigt stille, plaudert nicht (“Be Still, Stop Chattering”), commonly called the Coffee Cantata, a light-hearted operetta about the struggles of parenting and how a father, Schlendrian, tries to save his daughter Liesgen from her own lusts. When we listen to the Cantata today, it depicts how greatly people once feared coffee! During the coffee ban, rumors were spread about the negative affects of our beloved beverage claiming it was a <strong>devilish drink unfit for children, women, and men concerned about their virility.</strong> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Melanie King, author of <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3X3Qe0w\">Tea, Coffee &amp; Chocolate: How We Fell in Love with Caffeine</a></em>, said, \"Early critics of coffee felt that Englishmen [particularly] were too prone to copying the Turks, whom they thought originated coffee. Coffee was described as a 'mere decoction of the Devil' and supposedly tasted like the 'syrrop of soot' or the 'essence of old shoes'.\"</p>\n<div class=\"AdWrapper-fFnhsA kzbamD ad giibfe\">\n<div class=\"ad__slot ad__slot--in-content\" data-node-id=\"65g5t4\">\n<div id=\"cns-ads-slot-type-in-content-0\" class=\"cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-in-content cns-ads-slot-type-in-content-0\" data-name=\"in_content_0\" data-slot-type=\"in_content\">\n<div id=\"in_content_0\" class=\"cns-ads-container\" data-node-id=\"65g5t4\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>It didn’t help that in that time coffeehouses were a rowdy place. Musicians played music and partied, men and women mingled freely without chaperones, people told dirty jokes, and, if rumors are true, political plots were born.</p>\n<p>So, in the eyes of Bach's father character, Schlendrian, coffee was not the beverage for a good girl, and coffeehouses were no place for respectable women. In 17th-century England, women were often barred from entry. </p>\n<p>Schlendrian pulls out all his cards in an effort to make Liesgen give up her coffee habit. He tries to ground Liesgen though it does not work, telling her she’s banned from attending weddings and parties. He claims he will stop buying her dresses and bonnets. Liesgen, though, remains unfazed. But then he ups the stakes: Until she gives up coffee, there will be no husband!</p>\n<p>Take a listen to the Coffee Cantata <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6Loyexw3uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> to find out if Liesgen gets her way or if her father stops her coffee shenanigans. </p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B6Loyexw3uk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>\n<p>You can get your copy of the score for the Coffee Cantata <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3XUBF0n\">here</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3XUBF0n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/37/31T4RVUmmL._SX348_BO1204203200_.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"182\" height=\"237\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/37/responsive/31T4RVUmmL._SX348_BO1204203200_-xs.jpg 300w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/37/responsive/31T4RVUmmL._SX348_BO1204203200_-sm.jpg 480w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/37/responsive/31T4RVUmmL._SX348_BO1204203200_-md.jpg 768w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/37/responsive/31T4RVUmmL._SX348_BO1204203200_-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/37/responsive/31T4RVUmmL._SX348_BO1204203200_-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/37/responsive/31T4RVUmmL._SX348_BO1204203200_-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></figure></a></p>\n<p>We definitely have to agree with Liesgen on this one!

With the added emphasis on art, new, creative ways of teaching are emerging.

Music lessons can be expensive and time consuming; but the benefits far overshadow the costs. Even adults can reap the rewards of learning music.<br><br>The brain receives a big boost from learning music, according to neuropsychologist <a href=\"https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Hanna-Pladdy-Brenda/\">Brenda Hanna-Pladdy </a>. Music training “creat[es] additional neural connections in childhood that can last a lifetime and thus help compensate for cognitive declines later in life”. This includes an increase in cognitive function, assistance with memory loss, and increased vocabulary later into adult life. Recent studies suggest that “playing a musical instrument throughout life is associated with a lower risk of developing dementia”, the memory loss disorder often centered around older people. According to a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2996135/\">study</a> done by Catherine Y. Wan and Gottfriend Schlaug, the association of motor actions, such as finger placements, and sound and visual patterns, creates a strengthening of connections between the auditory and motor regions of the brain. This association strengthens the brain itself, allowing for increased plasticity, the brain’s ability to change. Neuroplasticity is important in aging, as it keeps the brain “young” and in top shape for memories and awareness.<br><br>The brain consists of <a href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/ZDWDdjjv65YLfVX2A\">two sides</a>, the left and right hemispheres. The left side of the brain is considered the “language and reasoning” side, whereas the right side is associated with creativity. With this in mind, it’s easy to see how the brain is fully exercised with music learning. The left side of the brain is learning, making associations, and picking up small details. The right side of the brain is immersed in the music and emotions from playing. With the left side of the brain being used constantly in music learning, language skills are more fine-tuned in children that study music than those who do not. This increased ability is helpful from the very beginning. Increased vocabulary and word association can be applied to any aspect of a child’s life, and most importantly, a school setting.<br><br>Music in itself offers a large benefit to the brain. Stress has quite a negative impact on the body, but music shows itself as a stress (and pain, anxiety, and overall mood booster) reliever. Research has found that listening to music releases biochemical stress reducers, reduces the heart’s rate (which puts less pressure on the body), lowers blood pressure, and increases serotonin and endorphins in the body, key <a href=\"https://atlasbiomed.com/blog/serotonin-and-other-happy-molecules-made-by-gut-bacteria/#:~:text=Serotonin%2C%20dopamine%2C%20oxytocin%2C%20and,also%20your%20mood%20and%20feelings.\">“happy hormones” </a>.<br><br>No matter the age of your child, or how old you are as an adult, learning music is a great way to boost many brain functions. While we never said learning music would be easy, it sure is worth it for the brain.</p>",

You prepare to take out your workbook and multiplication tables, but for some reason, your teacher decides to hand out maracas and sheet music to every student. With a confused look on your face, you pick up the bead-filled percussion instrument and try to figure out when the numbers are going to start showing up. Unbeknownst to you, you are about to embark on an engaging mathematical adventure that will make math fun and easier to grasp.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As musicians, sometimes we can get tunnel vision when it comes to reading and playing music. We receive the sheet music, identify the time and key signatures, peruse to notes and then get to playing. We fail to realize how much elementary math we use on a daily basis while reading and playing music, but this didn’t go unnoticed by a group of San Francisco State University researchers, who went on to found a program called Academic Music. The program sought to teach third graders about fractions through music.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The program focused on relating time signatures and rhythmic patterns to fractions.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/33/guitar-homework.jpeg\" alt=\"girl doing guitar homework\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/33/responsive/guitar-homework-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/33/responsive/guitar-homework-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/33/responsive/guitar-homework-md.jpeg 768w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/33/responsive/guitar-homework-lg.jpeg 1024w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/33/responsive/guitar-homework-xl.jpeg 1360w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/33/responsive/guitar-homework-2xl.jpeg 1600w\"></figure>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Students would be introduced to the time signature 4/4 as four notes in the measure. So a whole note would be the full four out of four in a single note, having two notes would mean that both notes are equal to half (2/4) and having four notes would mean that each note was equal to a quarter (1/4). The same mindset applies to the 2/4 time signature, which would then introduce the more complicated concept of eighth notes, where 1/8 + 1/8 = 2/8, which can then be simplified to 1/4, which then puts it in clear context with the time signature. While students are learning this, they would also be keeping count with the beat by either clamping or using a percussion instrument such as a maraca. Students would then take this understanding into addition and subtraction of fractions using musical notes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The researchers used this program to statistically analyze if incorporating music into teaching math significantly improved the children’s math learning and abilities. Statistical tests showed that students responded better to the music-infused instruction than not. In other words, students who were weaker in their fraction understanding benefitting immensely from the Academic Music program, reflecting a similar fraction understanding as their higher-achieving peers at the end of the program.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adding music to math would accomplish two major goals and based on the research and feasibility of the concept, I would highly recommend that most, if not all, elementary schools take it up. Firstly, as shown through statistical analysis, music essentially made math fun to learn, making it easier to grasp. And let’s face it, if anything can make math fun then we ought to keep it. Secondly, it would encourage more schools to keep their music programs, as sadly, music programs tend to be the first programs to be cut once schools experience budget cuts. Music programs are very much under appreciated and this is just one of the many reasons why music education at an early age is important.</p>",

In 1859, the French government passed a law standardizing tuning to 435Hz. However, in 1834, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Heinrich_Scheibler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Johann Heinrich Scheibler</a> invented the \"tonometer\", a device with 56 tuning forks, and recommended the use of 440Hz. In 1926, the American music industry also reached the informal standard of 440Hz; some manufacturers even began producing instruments in the frequency. <br><br>The world came to an <a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/567558690314781330/3902404739890066231\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">agreement</a> in 1953, the middle \"A\" on the the piano would be tuned to 440Hz. To this day, the argument between the frequencies continues. </p>\n<h3>The Fight for 432Hz</h3>\n<p>Many people believe that 432Hz is more in tune with the universe, offering physical and mental advantages. In Paul Davids' YouTube <a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/567558690314781330/3902404739890066231\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a>, he offers a great explanation, \"There is belief among some that 432 is more in harmony with the universe.\" When playing in 432 tuning, middle C is closer to 256Hz, a frequency that is a multiple of 8Hz, a rate that is known as <a href=\"https://alltecglobal.com/articles/lightning/the-earths-heartbeat/#:~:text=The%20Earth%27s%20heartbeat%20cannot%20be,is%20regulated%20by%20electrical%20impulses.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“the heartbeat of Earth.”</a> 432Hz also resonates with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">golden ratio.</a> <br><br>While many people talk about the positive effects 432Hz has on the body, and the possible negative effects 440Hz has (check out <a href=\"http://podcast.sjrdesign.net/shownotes_141.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this </a>conspiracy podcast about 440Hz), studies haven't been able to show anything other than a personal preference. A <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31031095/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study </a>have been able to find minimal differences in the frequencies and bodily rates, such as a slight decrease in blood pressure values, a slight decrease in respiratory rates, and a decrease in mean heart rate. The key word here is \"slight\", and unfortunately for the 432Hz team, isn't enough proof for their cause. In order for something to be regarded as \"healthy\" and overall better for you, extensive research needs to be done. There are a lot of variables for a study of this sort, making it nearly impossible. Think of all of the instruments that need to be studied, controlled, and tested, along with every possible health outcome.<br><br>I'm sure we'll have this few centuries old question answered at some point in the future, but what frequency do you prefer?

You must be thinking — Gee, I think this guy has finally lost it if he believes Mozart is a woman, though I assure you that I'm quite coherent. Let's address the elephant in the room. Now who exactly am I talking about? Keep in mind that Mozart is the famous composer's surname, which means that it's a possibility that I'm talking about someone related to him, and to which I would say you're right on the money. It kind of reminds me of how we tend to address Barack Obama as just Obama and sometimes we forget that it's actually his last name, quite the phenomenon. Anyways, asides my trivial ramblings, today we're going to celebrate the life and talent of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's older sister, Maria Anna Walburga Ignatia Mozart. (She was known as Nannerl for short).</p>\n<p>I seems that musical talent is synonymous with the name Mozart and surely it ran in the family. Despite her relation to one of history's greatest composer, she held her own compared to her brother. Some experts argue that Nannerl was the most gifted and talented musician under the Mozart name, even more talented than Wolfgang himself. Not only was she masterful at the harpsichord akin to her younger brother but she was also a composer in her own right. There is a story where she sent a composition to her brother in 1770 and he responded with a letter stating, \"My dead sister! I am in awe that you can compose so well, in a word, the song you wrote is beautiful.\" Essentially no sibling rivalry or bitter competition existed between the two Mozart children, and if anything Mozart was encouraging a supportive of his sister's accomplishments and endeavors. Together as a family along with their father Leopold, they toured Europe during the 18th century, making beautiful music together as a family. Now what more could you ask for?</p>\n<p>You might be asking yourself that if she really was this much of a virtuoso, then why is she so seldom remembered when we talk about Mozart? I'd argue that Nannerl was unfortunately born too early, which caused her to be mostly forgotten in the pages of history. Remember that this is all taking place in the 1700s Europe, a place and time where equal rights between men and women unfortunately didn't exist. Specifically pertaining to female composers, only those of nobility were able to have their music exposed to the public. This is probably why much of Nannerl's work didn't survive up until today. It's said that Nannerl helped to write down Wolfgang's compositions when he was too young to do it himself, so its possible that some of those compositions are, in fact, hers. Furthermore, it was a time and place where if women were actually profiting off of their musicality, then they were deemed prostitutes, which just sounds utterly insulting but was the norm way back when. She was also hindered from growing as a musician when she was of marrying age by her father, who stopped bringing her on tour with them at that time. Despite that, she spent those years up until she was married composing, though as mentioned before, there's virtually no record of them today. I wonder why she was forced to stop when she became of marrying age, would men be too intimidated by a very talented and successful female? I hate the 1700s.</p>\n<p>Now, if she were born in maybe the 20th or 21st century, I truly believe that her innate talent would be so much more appreciated by everyone and she would become a household name in the realm of composers and musicians. Though given all the different genres of music popular these days, it's also possible she would venture off into another type of music and gain popularity there. Could you imagine her with a guitar rocking out with a band? Who really knows, alternate timelines are confusing. </p>\n<p>Regardless, another big reason why I believe she could've become more well known in a more recent time period is because there was no competition between her and Wolfgang. Because of that, they were able to grow as musicians together instead of butting heads and holding each other back. The reason she is not well known is in no part Wolfgang's fault, that burden rests on the bitter shoulders of history itself. </p>\n<p>Many of those today who truly believe that Nannerl deserved more recognition have been making it a point of emphasis that she should be known. In 2010, a French filmmaker named René Féret produced a film called <i><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3RpxPtB\">Mozart's Sister film</a></i>, which attempted to show the life of Nannerl with speculations of what her early life could've looked like. Of course, that is really impossible to know because so little has been documented specifically about her life, though reviews claim the film to be very well-made. It does do an amazing job bringing Nannerl into the spotlight. The play initially hit venues across the world in 2015 and there probably aren't any showings anytime soon because of the pandemic, though I'm going to keep my eye out for it.</p>\n<p>There is also a book by the same title, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3JufgCP\">Mozart's Sister Book</a>, which is appropriate for young readers as well.</p>\n<p>It's truly a travesty that the stories of extraordinary women of the past in the book of history tend to be left unturned and subjected to erosion. Such is the case with Nannerl Mozart. It's refreshing to see recent attempts to recollect and remember her life's story. With the musicianship and pedigree of talent she possessed, she deserves recognition.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<div class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<div class=\"byline post-share-buttons goog-inline-block\"> </div>\n</div>\n</div>",

            "content_html": "<p>In 2014, Amazon released the comedy-drama series <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Rl65Gw\">Mozart in the Jungle on Amazon</a>. Inspired by oboist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blair_Tindall\">Blair Tindall</a>’s memoir, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Dumq6i\">Mozart in the Jungle: Sex, Drugs, and Classical Music</a>, the four-season show focuses on the daily doings of the musicians in the New York Symphony. <br><br>The show focuses on the Symphany’s new conductor, Rodrigo (who is based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavo_Dudamel\">Gustavo Dudamel</a>), played by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gael_Garc%C3%ADa_Bernal\">Gael García Bernal</a>. The character Hailey Rutledge is based after Tindall, who is a new oboist dying to get into the symphony. The rest of the cast is put together splendidly, offering great depth in the film. </p>\n<p><br>Well this is...fun?<br><br>How many of you were excited to go to music class in your younger years so you could have fun playing music, laugh with your friends, and relax from the typical classroom setting; only to find out you had to watch a boring documentary on a classical musician, and take notes? Or is that just me? <br><br>Thankfully, Mozart in the Jungle is different. It is of course a show, and not completely factual, but there is still plenty to get out of it, without taking notes and falling asleep every scene. The characters show emotion, the symphony is struggling financially, some are having identity crises; everything is real.  <br><br><br><br>Women Classical Musicians Exist?<br><br>Not only do women musicians exist, but they often don’t get as much recognition as male musicians. It’s not because women don’t want to or simply don’t play, but there is still a huge rift in the music world when it comes to gender equality.<br><br>That being said, I was quite excited that Mozart in the Jungle spent as much time on the female characters as it did on the males. Although it’s only fair, as the show is based off of a woman’s piece of work; but the media being the media, they could have easily skewed that aspect. <br><br>Hailey starts off as Rodrigo’s assistant, spending a lot of time making the conductor’s tea. Hailey becomes an equal star in the show over time, and takes control over her identity; something I’m sure all musicians can relate to at some point in their lives and careers. <br>________________________________________________________________<br><br>Most shows, documentaries, or books about classical music are stiff and almost lifeless. Mozart in the Jungle shows the lives of a musician outside of their art; because after all, they do have one. If you would like to experience the raw, humorous, and captivating show that is Mozart in the Jungle, check out the trailer!</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QixpBQcGAqc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>And get to practicing, we all know how inspired we get by entertainment films!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I'm sure many of you have heard the sentiment that music is the universal language. No matter what our mother tongue is, we can all but impacted in the same way by the same kind of music regardless of the language that piece of music is sung in or derived from. Not only can the aforementioned sentiment be attributed to people across the world, but we can apply it to animals as well. It's no surprise that animals have the ability to respond to music; there have been many studies conducted to prove it as well. For example, a 2001 study at the University of Leicester found that cows tend to produce more milk when listening to slower music. In another example, a 2012 study done at Emory University found that the parts in a bird's brain that react when listening to music is similar to the parts of a human's brain that reacts as well. I can go on and on about more fascinating studies because they are all really quite interesting. However, in this post, I'm going to specifically be talking about one animal in particular, the elephant. </p>\n<p>The elephant is quite the intelligent creature. Its memory is practically unrivaled, it has shown the ability to use tools and can distinguish different human languages. With a brain like that, elephants has expressed a keen aptitude for listening to human music. Just take the Thai Elephant Orchestra as a prime example of this. Musician and neuroscientist Dave Soldier along with conversationalist Richard Lair founded this orchestra back in 2000, which features up to 16 elephants playing instruments specifically made for them such as steel drums or harmonicas. You can read more about the founders and the orchestra via this <a href=\"http://davesoldier.com/thaiorch.html\">link</a>. Personally I thought stuff like this only existed inside the pages of a picture book, yet here I am amazed and sorely mistaken. We are going to venture back to Thailand to talk about the amazing story of Paul Barton and his elephants.</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i1qQOGCyRbY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Barton's career in the arts started at the age of 16, but not the type of arts you'd initially think. He studied arts at the Royal Academy of Arts in London and one prizes in portrait painting and portrait drawing in student competitions and would soon have his work exhibited at various exhibitions. Despite his early success with portrait art, he decided to make a career out of being a concert pianist. His career started off strong with many great performances to his name, though he quickly decided that it wasn't the life that he wanted. This career change led him to travel to Thailand where he taught piano at the Thai Piano School; he would also go on to meet his future wife there as well and decided begin a new life there. On his 50th birthday, his wife asked him what it is he'd like to do and that was when this fascinating story began. He decided he wanted to play piano for elephants.</p>\n<p>Thailand was infamous for subjecting elephants to hard labor, specifically logging. After deforestation was declared illegal a number of years ago, those elephants were set free from their lives of arduous labors. Many of those elephants were of old age, injured or handicapped and would end up at Elephant's World, a safe haven for these elephants that offer them a place to recover and relax. Barton decided that these elephants needed more than just an open space to relax and took it upon himself to offer his services to these wounded animals. His first client was an elephant named Plara, who's work in logging caused her to go blind and was tossed aside like nothing after she was no longer useful. Barton recalled his previous work with blind children and how music impacted them and applied this to Plara, playing the piano live for her. Plara had been in the middle of eating (and elephants will eat to no avail), but when Barton started playing some Beethoven, Plara stopped eating just to enjoy the music.</p>\n<p>This was the start of his YouTube channel, which to this date has amassed over 540k subscribers. A lot of his content involves piano playing and portrait painting, but his most popular content by far is when he posts videos of him out in the open with a piano comforting a handicapped elephant. It's definitely interesting to watch the interactions between Barton and the elephants, especially given the PTSD the elephants must be suffering at the hands of humans. Elephants can be violent and with the way humans have treated these creatures, they should have resentment towards humans  Because of this history, Barton makes it a point of emphasis to move the piano all the way to where the elephants are (which is in the mountains), just to comfort them. \"What is the little thing I can do as a human to say sorry, for my species for what we have done to them?,\" Barton said. \"I'll carry this heavy thing myself and play some music for the elephant while it is having some breakfast.</p>\n<p>Barton is truly a kind soul and the work that he's doing is altruistic and amazing. I highly encourage that you check out his YouTube channel and see his interactions with elephants for yourself. You can see it all <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/PaulBartonThailand/videos\">here</a>. I'm glad that these elephants have Barton, after the life they've endured, it's the least they deserve.</p>",
