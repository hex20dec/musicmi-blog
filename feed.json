The Soviets had successfully launched Earth's <a href=\"https://history.nasa.gov/sputnik.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first artificial satellite</a> in 1957, leaving the U.S. in the dust. For decades, the United States had been trailing behind other countries in student proficiency in <strong>S</strong>cience, <strong>T</strong>echnology, <strong>E</strong>ngineering, and <strong>M</strong>ath. In the early 2000's, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics#United_States\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">STEM</a>, originally SMET, was introduced in hopes of bridging the education gap, and putting America back on top.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>This was done by raising awareness in the public eye. Schoolboards and Colleges began promoting STEM subjects and majors, reminding students that \"science and math are critical to a basic understanding of the universe, while engineering and technology are a means for people to interact with the universe.\" </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Everyone played a part in the rekindling interest of scientific education; teachers received extra continuing education on the subjects and how to teach them more effectively, and students, in turn, received the new and improved curriculum. </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>\n<div>The Addition of \"A\"</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>\n<div>STEM was reintroduced as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEAM_fields\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">STEAM </a>in 2006, adding \"Art\" to the mix. While the specific art in question can change based on who you're talking to, the addition of the arts has seen plenty of love. </div>\n<div>It's no question that most 6 year old's would go crazy in a scientific learning environment like the one's we see in college lecture halls. With the added emphasis on art, new, creative ways of teaching are emerging. This allows for students, especially young ones, or even students that don't enjoy learning, the ability to become interested in the subject matters. </div>\n<h3><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/35/artificial-intelligence-gc83e3f5e5_1920.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/35/responsive/artificial-intelligence-gc83e3f5e5_1920-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/35/responsive/artificial-intelligence-gc83e3f5e5_1920-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/35/responsive/artificial-intelligence-gc83e3f5e5_1920-md.jpeg 768w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/35/responsive/artificial-intelligence-gc83e3f5e5_1920-lg.jpeg 1024w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/35/responsive/artificial-intelligence-gc83e3f5e5_1920-xl.jpeg 1360w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/35/responsive/artificial-intelligence-gc83e3f5e5_1920-2xl.jpeg 1600w\"></figure></h3>\n<h3>What Art Brings</h3>\n<div>Arts, whether it be in the fashion world, fine arts, or even music, require a varying degree of STEM knowledge, which STEAM brings to light. </div>\n<div>Music is built on repetition and creative learning skills. This prompts a well-off memory recall, aiding in STEM studies.</div>\n<div>Music is well known to be a place for creative expression, but that doesn't have to be limited to <i>just </i>music. Having an activity to jumpstart creativity can have major breakthroughs in the scientific world as well. </div>\n<div>Inventions didn't come from a person sitting bored to death in a classroom setting, it (more than likely) came from a place of creativity. </div>\n</div>\n<div> </div>\n<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong>S</strong>cience, <strong>T</strong>echnology, <strong>E</strong>ngineering, and <strong>M</strong>ath are important skillsets and careers to obtain, but so are skills in the Arts. The Arts get a bad rep, often labeling artists as unintelligible for pursuing a career outside of the scientific community. However, artistic careers are surrounded with plenty of competition and talent, making them some of the hardest careers to attain. The inclusive \"<strong>A</strong>\" in <strong>STEAM</strong> sheds light on artists, and brings their creative skillsets to other industries; something I think any professional can appreciate. </div>\n</div>",

Music lessons can be expensive and time consuming; but the benefits far overshadow the costs. Even adults can reap the rewards of learning music.<br><br>The brain receives a big boost from learning music, according to neuropsychologist <a href=\"https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Hanna-Pladdy-Brenda/\">Brenda Hanna-Pladdy </a>. Music training “creat[es] additional neural connections in childhood that can last a lifetime and thus help compensate for cognitive declines later in life”. This includes an increase in cognitive function, assistance with memory loss, and increased vocabulary later into adult life. Recent studies suggest that “playing a musical instrument throughout life is associated with a lower risk of developing dementia”, the memory loss disorder often centered around older people. According to a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2996135/\">study</a> done by Catherine Y. Wan and Gottfriend Schlaug, the association of motor actions, such as finger placements, and sound and visual patterns, creates a strengthening of connections between the auditory and motor regions of the brain. This association strengthens the brain itself, allowing for increased plasticity, the brain’s ability to change. Neuroplasticity is important in aging, as it keeps the brain “young” and in top shape for memories and awareness.<br><br>The brain consists of <a href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/ZDWDdjjv65YLfVX2A\">two sides</a>, the left and right hemispheres. The left side of the brain is considered the “language and reasoning” side, whereas the right side is associated with creativity. With this in mind, it’s easy to see how the brain is fully exercised with music learning. The left side of the brain is learning, making associations, and picking up small details. The right side of the brain is immersed in the music and emotions from playing. With the left side of the brain being used constantly in music learning, language skills are more fine-tuned in children that study music than those who do not. This increased ability is helpful from the very beginning. Increased vocabulary and word association can be applied to any aspect of a child’s life, and most importantly, a school setting.<br><br>Music in itself offers a large benefit to the brain. Stress has quite a negative impact on the body, but music shows itself as a stress (and pain, anxiety, and overall mood booster) reliever. Research has found that listening to music releases biochemical stress reducers, reduces the heart’s rate (which puts less pressure on the body), lowers blood pressure, and increases serotonin and endorphins in the body, key <a href=\"https://atlasbiomed.com/blog/serotonin-and-other-happy-molecules-made-by-gut-bacteria/#:~:text=Serotonin%2C%20dopamine%2C%20oxytocin%2C%20and,also%20your%20mood%20and%20feelings.\">“happy hormones” </a>.<br><br>No matter the age of your child, or how old you are as an adult, learning music is a great way to boost many brain functions. While we never said learning music would be easy, it sure is worth it for the brain.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Imagine sitting in your third grade classroom and next up on the agenda is math. You prepare to take out your workbook and multiplication tables, but for some reason, your teacher decides to hand out maracas and sheet music to every student. With a confused look on your face, you pick up the bead-filled percussion instrument and try to figure out when the numbers are going to start showing up. Unbeknownst to you, you are about to embark on an engaging mathematical adventure that will make math fun and easier to grasp.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As musicians, sometimes we can get tunnel vision when it comes to reading and playing music. We receive the sheet music, identify the time and key signatures, peruse to notes and then get to playing. We fail to realize how much elementary math we use on a daily basis while reading and playing music, but this didn’t go unnoticed by a group of San Francisco State University researchers, who went on to found a program called Academic Music. The program sought to teach third graders about fractions through music.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The program focused on relating time signatures and rhythmic patterns to fractions.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/33/guitar-homework.jpeg\" alt=\"girl doing guitar homework\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/33/responsive/guitar-homework-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/33/responsive/guitar-homework-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/33/responsive/guitar-homework-md.jpeg 768w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/33/responsive/guitar-homework-lg.jpeg 1024w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/33/responsive/guitar-homework-xl.jpeg 1360w ,https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/33/responsive/guitar-homework-2xl.jpeg 1600w\"></figure>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Students would be introduced to the time signature 4/4 as four notes in the measure. So a whole note would be the full four out of four in a single note, having two notes would mean that both notes are equal to half (2/4) and having four notes would mean that each note was equal to a quarter (1/4). The same mindset applies to the 2/4 time signature, which would then introduce the more complicated concept of eighth notes, where 1/8 + 1/8 = 2/8, which can then be simplified to 1/4, which then puts it in clear context with the time signature. While students are learning this, they would also be keeping count with the beat by either clamping or using a percussion instrument such as a maraca. Students would then take this understanding into addition and subtraction of fractions using musical notes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The researchers used this program to statistically analyze if incorporating music into teaching math significantly improved the children’s math learning and abilities. Statistical tests showed that students responded better to the music-infused instruction than not. In other words, students who were weaker in their fraction understanding benefitting immensely from the Academic Music program, reflecting a similar fraction understanding as their higher-achieving peers at the end of the program.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adding music to math would accomplish two major goals and based on the research and feasibility of the concept, I would highly recommend that most, if not all, elementary schools take it up. Firstly, as shown through statistical analysis, music essentially made math fun to learn, making it easier to grasp. And let’s face it, if anything can make math fun then we ought to keep it. Secondly, it would encourage more schools to keep their music programs, as sadly, music programs tend to be the first programs to be cut once schools experience budget cuts. Music programs are very much under appreciated and this is just one of the many reasons why music education at an early age is important.</p>",

In 1859, the French government passed a law standardizing tuning to 435Hz. However, in 1834, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Heinrich_Scheibler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Johann Heinrich Scheibler</a> invented the \"tonometer\", a device with 56 tuning forks, and recommended the use of 440Hz. In 1926, the American music industry also reached the informal standard of 440Hz; some manufacturers even began producing instruments in the frequency. <br><br>The world came to an <a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/567558690314781330/3902404739890066231\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">agreement</a> in 1953, the middle \"A\" on the the piano would be tuned to 440Hz. To this day, the argument between the frequencies continues. </p>\n<h3>The Fight for 432Hz</h3>\n<p>Many people believe that 432Hz is more in tune with the universe, offering physical and mental advantages. In Paul Davids' YouTube <a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/567558690314781330/3902404739890066231\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a>, he offers a great explanation, \"There is belief among some that 432 is more in harmony with the universe.\" When playing in 432 tuning, middle C is closer to 256Hz, a frequency that is a multiple of 8Hz, a rate that is known as <a href=\"https://alltecglobal.com/articles/lightning/the-earths-heartbeat/#:~:text=The%20Earth%27s%20heartbeat%20cannot%20be,is%20regulated%20by%20electrical%20impulses.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“the heartbeat of Earth.”</a> 432Hz also resonates with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">golden ratio.</a> <br><br>While many people talk about the positive effects 432Hz has on the body, and the possible negative effects 440Hz has (check out <a href=\"http://podcast.sjrdesign.net/shownotes_141.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this </a>conspiracy podcast about 440Hz), studies haven't been able to show anything other than a personal preference. A <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31031095/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study </a>have been able to find minimal differences in the frequencies and bodily rates, such as a slight decrease in blood pressure values, a slight decrease in respiratory rates, and a decrease in mean heart rate. The key word here is \"slight\", and unfortunately for the 432Hz team, isn't enough proof for their cause. In order for something to be regarded as \"healthy\" and overall better for you, extensive research needs to be done. There are a lot of variables for a study of this sort, making it nearly impossible. Think of all of the instruments that need to be studied, controlled, and tested, along with every possible health outcome.<br><br>I'm sure we'll have this few centuries old question answered at some point in the future, but what frequency do you prefer?

You must be thinking — Gee, I think this guy has finally lost it if he believes Mozart is a woman, though I assure you that I'm quite coherent. Let's address the elephant in the room. Now who exactly am I talking about? Keep in mind that Mozart is the famous composer's surname, which means that it's a possibility that I'm talking about someone related to him, and to which I would say you're right on the money. It kind of reminds me of how we tend to address Barack Obama as just Obama and sometimes we forget that it's actually his last name, quite the phenomenon. Anyways, asides my trivial ramblings, today we're going to celebrate the life and talent of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's older sister, Maria Anna Walburga Ignatia Mozart. (She was known as Nannerl for short).</p>\n<p>I seems that musical talent is synonymous with the name Mozart and surely it ran in the family. Despite her relation to one of history's greatest composer, she held her own compared to her brother. Some experts argue that Nannerl was the most gifted and talented musician under the Mozart name, even more talented than Wolfgang himself. Not only was she masterful at the harpsichord akin to her younger brother but she was also a composer in her own right. There is a story where she sent a composition to her brother in 1770 and he responded with a letter stating, \"My dead sister! I am in awe that you can compose so well, in a word, the song you wrote is beautiful.\" Essentially no sibling rivalry or bitter competition existed between the two Mozart children, and if anything Mozart was encouraging a supportive of his sister's accomplishments and endeavors. Together as a family along with their father Leopold, they toured Europe during the 18th century, making beautiful music together as a family. Now what more could you ask for?</p>\n<p>You might be asking yourself that if she really was this much of a virtuoso, then why is she so seldom remembered when we talk about Mozart? I'd argue that Nannerl was unfortunately born too early, which caused her to be mostly forgotten in the pages of history. Remember that this is all taking place in the 1700s Europe, a place and time where equal rights between men and women unfortunately didn't exist. Specifically pertaining to female composers, only those of nobility were able to have their music exposed to the public. This is probably why much of Nannerl's work didn't survive up until today. It's said that Nannerl helped to write down Wolfgang's compositions when he was too young to do it himself, so its possible that some of those compositions are, in fact, hers. Furthermore, it was a time and place where if women were actually profiting off of their musicality, then they were deemed prostitutes, which just sounds utterly insulting but was the norm way back when. She was also hindered from growing as a musician when she was of marrying age by her father, who stopped bringing her on tour with them at that time. Despite that, she spent those years up until she was married composing, though as mentioned before, there's virtually no record of them today. I wonder why she was forced to stop when she became of marrying age, would men be too intimidated by a very talented and successful female? I hate the 1700s.</p>\n<p>Now, if she were born in maybe the 20th or 21st century, I truly believe that her innate talent would be so much more appreciated by everyone and she would become a household name in the realm of composers and musicians. Though given all the different genres of music popular these days, it's also possible she would venture off into another type of music and gain popularity there. Could you imagine her with a guitar rocking out with a band? Who really knows, alternate timelines are confusing. </p>\n<p>Regardless, another big reason why I believe she could've become more well known in a more recent time period is because there was no competition between her and Wolfgang. Because of that, they were able to grow as musicians together instead of butting heads and holding each other back. The reason she is not well known is in no part Wolfgang's fault, that burden rests on the bitter shoulders of history itself. </p>\n<p>Many of those today who truly believe that Nannerl deserved more recognition have been making it a point of emphasis that she should be known. In 2010, a French filmmaker named René Féret produced a film called <i><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3RpxPtB\">Mozart's Sister film</a></i>, which attempted to show the life of Nannerl with speculations of what her early life could've looked like. Of course, that is really impossible to know because so little has been documented specifically about her life, though reviews claim the film to be very well-made. It does do an amazing job bringing Nannerl into the spotlight. The play initially hit venues across the world in 2015 and there probably aren't any showings anytime soon because of the pandemic, though I'm going to keep my eye out for it.</p>\n<p>There is also a book by the same title, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3JufgCP\">Mozart's Sister Book</a>, which is appropriate for young readers as well.</p>\n<p>It's truly a travesty that the stories of extraordinary women of the past in the book of history tend to be left unturned and subjected to erosion. Such is the case with Nannerl Mozart. It's refreshing to see recent attempts to recollect and remember her life's story. With the musicianship and pedigree of talent she possessed, she deserves recognition.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<div class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<div class=\"byline post-share-buttons goog-inline-block\"> </div>\n</div>\n</div>",

The rest of the cast is put together splendidly, offering great depth in the film. </p>\n<p><br>Well this is...fun?<br><br>How many of you were excited to go to music class in your younger years so you could have fun playing music, laugh with your friends, and relax from the typical classroom setting; only to find out you had to watch a boring documentary on a classical musician, and take notes? Or is that just me? <br><br>Thankfully, Mozart in the Jungle is different. It is of course a show, and not completely factual, but there is still plenty to get out of it, without taking notes and falling asleep every scene. The characters show emotion, the symphony is struggling financially, some are having identity crises; everything is real.  <br><br><br><br>Women Classical Musicians Exist?<br><br>Not only do women musicians exist, but they often don’t get as much recognition as male musicians. It’s not because women don’t want to or simply don’t play, but there is still a huge rift in the music world when it comes to gender equality.<br><br>That being said, I was quite excited that Mozart in the Jungle spent as much time on the female characters as it did on the males. Although it’s only fair, as the show is based off of a woman’s piece of work; but the media being the media, they could have easily skewed that aspect. <br><br>Hailey starts off as Rodrigo’s assistant, spending a lot of time making the conductor’s tea. Hailey becomes an equal star in the show over time, and takes control over her identity; something I’m sure all musicians can relate to at some point in their lives and careers. <br>________________________________________________________________<br><br>Most shows, documentaries, or books about classical music are stiff and almost lifeless. Mozart in the Jungle shows the lives of a musician outside of their art; because after all, they do have one.

No matter what our mother tongue is, we can all but impacted in the same way by the same kind of music regardless of the language that piece of music is sung in or derived from. Not only can the aforementioned sentiment be attributed to people across the world, but we can apply it to animals as well. It's no surprise that animals have the ability to respond to music; there have been many studies conducted to prove it as well. For example, a 2001 study at the University of Leicester found that cows tend to produce more milk when listening to slower music. In another example, a 2012 study done at Emory University found that the parts in a bird's brain that react when listening to music is similar to the parts of a human's brain that reacts as well. I can go on and on about more fascinating studies because they are all really quite interesting. However, in this post, I'm going to specifically be talking about one animal in particular, the elephant. </p>\n<p>The elephant is quite the intelligent creature. Its memory is practically unrivaled, it has shown the ability to use tools and can distinguish different human languages. With a brain like that, elephants has expressed a keen aptitude for listening to human music. Just take the Thai Elephant Orchestra as a prime example of this. Musician and neuroscientist Dave Soldier along with conversationalist Richard Lair founded this orchestra back in 2000, which features up to 16 elephants playing instruments specifically made for them such as steel drums or harmonicas. You can read more about the founders and the orchestra via this <a href=\"http://davesoldier.com/thaiorch.html\">link</a>. Personally I thought stuff like this only existed inside the pages of a picture book, yet here I am amazed and sorely mistaken. We are going to venture back to Thailand to talk about the amazing story of Paul Barton and his elephants.</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i1qQOGCyRbY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Barton's career in the arts started at the age of 16, but not the type of arts you'd initially think. He studied arts at the Royal Academy of Arts in London and one prizes in portrait painting and portrait drawing in student competitions and would soon have his work exhibited at various exhibitions. Despite his early success with portrait art, he decided to make a career out of being a concert pianist. His career started off strong with many great performances to his name, though he quickly decided that it wasn't the life that he wanted. This career change led him to travel to Thailand where he taught piano at the Thai Piano School; he would also go on to meet his future wife there as well and decided begin a new life there. On his 50th birthday, his wife asked him what it is he'd like to do and that was when this fascinating story began. He decided he wanted to play piano for elephants.</p>\n<p>Thailand was infamous for subjecting elephants to hard labor, specifically logging. After deforestation was declared illegal a number of years ago, those elephants were set free from their lives of arduous labors. Many of those elephants were of old age, injured or handicapped and would end up at Elephant's World, a safe haven for these elephants that offer them a place to recover and relax. Barton decided that these elephants needed more than just an open space to relax and took it upon himself to offer his services to these wounded animals. His first client was an elephant named Plara, who's work in logging caused her to go blind and was tossed aside like nothing after she was no longer useful. Barton recalled his previous work with blind children and how music impacted them and applied this to Plara, playing the piano live for her. Plara had been in the middle of eating (and elephants will eat to no avail), but when Barton started playing some Beethoven, Plara stopped eating just to enjoy the music.</p>\n<p>This was the start of his YouTube channel, which to this date has amassed over 540k subscribers. A lot of his content involves piano playing and portrait painting, but his most popular content by far is when he posts videos of him out in the open with a piano comforting a handicapped elephant. It's definitely interesting to watch the interactions between Barton and the elephants, especially given the PTSD the elephants must be suffering at the hands of humans. Elephants can be violent and with the way humans have treated these creatures, they should have resentment towards humans  Because of this history, Barton makes it a point of emphasis to move the piano all the way to where the elephants are (which is in the mountains), just to comfort them. \"What is the little thing I can do as a human to say sorry, for my species for what we have done to them?,\" Barton said. \"I'll carry this heavy thing myself and play some music for the elephant while it is having some breakfast.</p>\n<p>Barton is truly a kind soul and the work that he's doing is altruistic and amazing. I highly encourage that you check out his YouTube channel and see his interactions with elephants for yourself. You can see it all <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/PaulBartonThailand/videos\">here</a>. I'm glad that these elephants have Barton, after the life they've endured, it's the least they deserve.</p>",

One of the most famous jazz musicians of all time, she was best know for her powerful vocal musicality and ability to improvise on the spot, an essential skill for any jazz musician. Today, we'll go over the extraordinary life and legacy of Billie Holiday.</p>\n<p>Billie Holiday was born on April 7, 1915 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Billie Holiday wasn't her birth given name though and there's a lot of confusion regarding her original name (some sources say Elinore Harris, others say Eleanora Fagan). Holiday was a result of a teenage pregnancy and unfortunately, her father wasn't around much when she was growing up. Though, her father was believed to be Clarence Holiday, who grew up to become a great jazz musician himself. I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree given where Billie ended up in her career.</p>\n<p>Her childhood didn't get any easier. Her mother, Sadie, would marry another man when she was just 5 years old, but he would end up leaving them to struggle a few years later. Billie would also choose to skip school and her and her mother were forced to go to court regarding her truancy. Billie would wind up at a facility for troubled African American girls at the age of 9. She returned to her mother's custody that same year, but would then be a victim of sexual assault just the next year. Despite all the hardship she's had to endure in her early childhood, she found comfort in music, especially Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith. </p>\n<p>Her singing career would begin at the age of 15, where she would sing at local clubs to put herself and her voice out there. This is around the same time she decided to take up the new name \"Billie\". At age 18, she would be discovered by producer John Hammond while she was singing at a Harlem jazz club. Hammond joined Holiday with rising musician Benny Goodman and with him, she would sing the vocals for various tracks. This would skyrocket her career as she would continue to collaborate with other jazz musicians. After joining Count Basie's orchestra, saxophonist Lester Young would give her the nickname \"Lady Day\", a moniker that she would be remembered by. She would then join Artie Shaw's orchestra, making history as the first female African American vocalist to work with a white orchestra. Though, the professional relationship wouldn't last long as unfortunately, promoters would ridicule her for her race and she would end up leaving the orchestra.</p>\n<p>She continued to be censored for her heritage in the music business. Columbia Records helped Holiday to debut arguably two of her most famous songs: \"God Bless the Child\" and \"Strange Fruit\". However, Columbia had no plans to produce \"Strange Fruit\" because of its underlying story about the lynching of African Americans in the South. She would instead record this song with the Commodore label and because of the controversy behind it, it would actually make the song even more famous. \"Strange Fruit\" would also gain even more notoriety as the song that the Federal Bureau of Narcotics tried to silence in conjunction with her narcotic issues. The commissioner of the FBN, Harry Anslinger, would go on to claim that her heroin addiction made \"Strange Fruit\" a dangerous song to release in the public. However, Anslinger was known to be racist and many people say Anslinger's motives to be derived from his hate for African American as opposed to Holiday's drug issues.</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dnlTHvJBeP0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IQlehVpcAes\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"post-body-container\">\n<div id=\"post-body-7120867020807585900\" class=\"post-body entry-content float-container\">\n<p>She was at the peak of her fame, but tragically it was cut short due to her own fatal choices. She was known to be a heavy drinker, and after marrying James Monroe in 1941, would pick up on smoking opium as well. While the marriage didn't last, her addiction to drugs did. She would start using heroin after meeting her next boyfriend and her drug and alcohol intake would only increase after the death of her mother in 1945. Even though her life would come full circle when she got the opportunity to share the big screen with one of her idols Louis Armstrong in the film <i>New Orleans</i> in 1947 and she continued touring throughout the 1950's, her drug and alcohol dependence finally caught up with her in 1959. She was arrested multiple times for possession of narcotics in the 50s, even once getting arrested after being admitted to the hospital for heart and liver issues. Holiday would succumb to drug and alcohol complications on July 17, 1959, an unfortunate death far too common among successful celebrities.</p>\n<p>Her music and legacy is still felt to this day. Her autobiography, <i></i><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3WMOatu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Lady Sings the Blues</i> </a>(which she reportedly did not read herself) was written with the help of William Dufty and would be turned into a film of the same name in 1972, which featured Diana Ross playing the late Billie Holiday. Holiday would also be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000. Even as recent as 2021, Holiday's legacy is felt as Hulu released <i>The United States Vs. Billie Holiday</i>, a film that specifically covered her debacle with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics regarding \"Strange Fruit\". The actress who played Holiday in the film, Andra Day, would win the Golden Globe for best actress in a drama in February 2021 and be honored by the Black Women Film Network for her tremendous job in the role. This is a great thing to see and I'm so glad that Holiday's memory is still very much with us, even more than 50 years later. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<div class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<div class=\"byline post-share-buttons goog-inline-block\"> </div>\n</div>\n</div>",

            "content_html": "<p> For this Women's History Month spotlight, we take you all the way back to 12th Century Germany. Hildegard Von Bingen, also known as Saint Hildegard, was a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedictine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Benedictine </a>Abbess, the head of the nuns. On top of her devoted Catholic life, Hildegard was also known for her writing, philosophy, visions, and musical compositions. <br><br>Hildegard was born in or around 1098 in the Rhineland, now Western Germany, to lower nobility parents. At the age of 8-14, her parents offered her as an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">oblate</a>, a person dedicated to serving God, which officially began her life in the religious sector. <br><br>From an early age, Hildegard reported visions, or what she called \"the reflection of the living light\". She believed that these visions were God talking to her through her five senses, and she later took a vision into interpretation to begin her writings.  </p>\n<h3>Musical Life</h3>\n<p>Hildegard's most popular composition is <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordo_Virtutum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ordo Virtutum</a></i>, Latin for \"Order of the Virtues\", a Latin mortality play that is comprised of 82 songs. Although the exact date is not known for certain, it's believed that this composition was released in 1151, making her the first woman composer in Western music. Ordo Virtutum is known to be the oldest surviving musical drama that is not attached to a liturgy, a public worship by a religious group. Take a listen to the Hildegard's most famous work below, which showcases the allegory of the Christian story, portrayed by the struggle between 16 Virtues and the Devil over the destiny of the female soul.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/26/Hildegard_von_Bingen_-_De_Spiritu_Santo.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"938\" height=\"552\"></figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Symphonia/OVlxDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Symphonia Armoniae Celestium Revelationum</a>,</i> a collection of 77 of Hildegard's liturgical songs, offer her views on her world at the time through hymns, antiphons, responsories, and sequences. While it is clear she was following classic and contemporary chanting styles in this collection, she pushed the musical boundaries of her time, offering something new that her community could sing along to. <br><br>For a women who claimed to be uneducated, Hildegard sure did spend a lot of time educating her community through music, as well as advocating for more freedom for the nuns she oversaw. Women were seen as far weaker than men in the 12th Century, and were never given the chance to be listened to, but by using her role as an Abbess, her words were heard more than any women in her time. Hildegard was officially recognized and labeled as a Saint in 2012 by Pope Benedict XVI. From the mouth of Saint Hildegard herself, \"woman may be made from man, but no man is made without a woman.\"<br><br>For more information on Hildegard's music and writings, I highly recommend you check out <a href=\"http://www.hildegard-society.org/p/music.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this </a>article and resource.</p>",
