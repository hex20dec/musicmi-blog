By gliding across the keyboard, you can produce various tones with a built-in speaker and a vibrato effect.</p>\n<p>Despite its compact size, the Stylophone has a rich history. It was first invented in 1968 by Brian Jarvis of Dubreq Studios in London, who stumbled upon the idea while repairing a toy piano for his niece. By replacing the keys with electronics, he created a monophonic organ with a distinctive, electronic sound.</p>\n<p>You may have heard the iconic Stylophone tone in popular music, particularly in David Bowie's \"Space Oddity.\"</p>\n<p>Today, a Stylophone is an affordable option, <strong>costing less than $40</strong>! Piano or keyboard players can use it to achieve interesting and creative results. In no time, you'll be playing your favorite tunes on this unique instrument.</p>\n<h1>2. Melodica (Mouth Organ)</h1>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3WUKR3B\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/32/71RVygQ20FL._AC_SL1500_.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1495\" height=\"1500\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/32/responsive/71RVygQ20FL._AC_SL1500_-xs.jpg 300w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/32/responsive/71RVygQ20FL._AC_SL1500_-sm.jpg 480w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/32/responsive/71RVygQ20FL._AC_SL1500_-md.jpg 768w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/32/responsive/71RVygQ20FL._AC_SL1500_-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/32/responsive/71RVygQ20FL._AC_SL1500_-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/32/responsive/71RVygQ20FL._AC_SL1500_-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></figure></a></p>\n<p>If you're in search of a more traditional musical instrument, the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3WUKR3B\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Melodica</a> is a classic, yet unique choice.

In 1859, the French government passed a law standardizing tuning to 435Hz. However, in 1834, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Heinrich_Scheibler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Johann Heinrich Scheibler</a> invented the \"tonometer\", a device with 56 tuning forks, and recommended the use of 440Hz. In 1926, the American music industry also reached the informal standard of 440Hz; some manufacturers even began producing instruments in the frequency. <br><br>The world came to an <a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/567558690314781330/3902404739890066231\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">agreement</a> in 1953, the middle \"A\" on the the piano would be tuned to 440Hz. To this day, the argument between the frequencies continues. </p>\n<h3>The Fight for 432Hz</h3>\n<p>Many people believe that 432Hz is more in tune with the universe, offering physical and mental advantages. In Paul Davids' YouTube <a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/567558690314781330/3902404739890066231\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a>, he offers a great explanation, \"There is belief among some that 432 is more in harmony with the universe.\" When playing in 432 tuning, middle C is closer to 256Hz, a frequency that is a multiple of 8Hz, a rate that is known as <a href=\"https://alltecglobal.com/articles/lightning/the-earths-heartbeat/#:~:text=The%20Earth%27s%20heartbeat%20cannot%20be,is%20regulated%20by%20electrical%20impulses.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“the heartbeat of Earth.”</a> 432Hz also resonates with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">golden ratio.</a> <br><br>While many people talk about the positive effects 432Hz has on the body, and the possible negative effects 440Hz has (check out <a href=\"http://podcast.sjrdesign.net/shownotes_141.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this </a>conspiracy podcast about 440Hz), studies haven't been able to show anything other than a personal preference. A <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31031095/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study </a>have been able to find minimal differences in the frequencies and bodily rates, such as a slight decrease in blood pressure values, a slight decrease in respiratory rates, and a decrease in mean heart rate. The key word here is \"slight\", and unfortunately for the 432Hz team, isn't enough proof for their cause. In order for something to be regarded as \"healthy\" and overall better for you, extensive research needs to be done. There are a lot of variables for a study of this sort, making it nearly impossible. Think of all of the instruments that need to be studied, controlled, and tested, along with every possible health outcome.<br><br>I'm sure we'll have this few centuries old question answered at some point in the future, but what frequency do you prefer? Or can you even tell a difference?

You must be thinking — Gee, I think this guy has finally lost it if he believes Mozart is a woman, though I assure you that I'm quite coherent. Let's address the elephant in the room. Now who exactly am I talking about? Keep in mind that Mozart is the famous composer's surname, which means that it's a possibility that I'm talking about someone related to him, and to which I would say you're right on the money. It kind of reminds me of how we tend to address Barack Obama as just Obama and sometimes we forget that it's actually his last name, quite the phenomenon. Anyways, asides my trivial ramblings, today we're going to celebrate the life and talent of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's older sister, Maria Anna Walburga Ignatia Mozart. (She was known as Nannerl for short).</p>\n<p>I seems that musical talent is synonymous with the name Mozart and surely it ran in the family. Despite her relation to one of history's greatest composer, she held her own compared to her brother. Some experts argue that Nannerl was the most gifted and talented musician under the Mozart name, even more talented than Wolfgang himself. Not only was she masterful at the harpsichord akin to her younger brother but she was also a composer in her own right. There is a story where she sent a composition to her brother in 1770 and he responded with a letter stating, \"My dead sister! I am in awe that you can compose so well, in a word, the song you wrote is beautiful.\" Essentially no sibling rivalry or bitter competition existed between the two Mozart children, and if anything Mozart was encouraging a supportive of his sister's accomplishments and endeavors. Together as a family along with their father Leopold, they toured Europe during the 18th century, making beautiful music together as a family. Now what more could you ask for?</p>\n<p>You might be asking yourself that if she really was this much of a virtuoso, then why is she so seldom remembered when we talk about Mozart? I'd argue that Nannerl was unfortunately born too early, which caused her to be mostly forgotten in the pages of history. Remember that this is all taking place in the 1700s Europe, a place and time where equal rights between men and women unfortunately didn't exist. Specifically pertaining to female composers, only those of nobility were able to have their music exposed to the public. This is probably why much of Nannerl's work didn't survive up until today. It's said that Nannerl helped to write down Wolfgang's compositions when he was too young to do it himself, so its possible that some of those compositions are, in fact, hers. Furthermore, it was a time and place where if women were actually profiting off of their musicality, then they were deemed prostitutes, which just sounds utterly insulting but was the norm way back when. She was also hindered from growing as a musician when she was of marrying age by her father, who stopped bringing her on tour with them at that time. Despite that, she spent those years up until she was married composing, though as mentioned before, there's virtually no record of them today. I wonder why she was forced to stop when she became of marrying age, would men be too intimidated by a very talented and successful female? I hate the 1700s.</p>\n<p>Now, if she were born in maybe the 20th or 21st century, I truly believe that her innate talent would be so much more appreciated by everyone and she would become a household name in the realm of composers and musicians. Though given all the different genres of music popular these days, it's also possible she would venture off into another type of music and gain popularity there. Could you imagine her with a guitar rocking out with a band? Who really knows, alternate timelines are confusing. </p>\n<p>Regardless, another big reason why I believe she could've become more well known in a more recent time period is because there was no competition between her and Wolfgang. Because of that, they were able to grow as musicians together instead of butting heads and holding each other back. The reason she is not well known is in no part Wolfgang's fault, that burden rests on the bitter shoulders of history itself. </p>\n<p>Many of those today who truly believe that Nannerl deserved more recognition have been making it a point of emphasis that she should be known. In 2010, a French filmmaker named René Féret produced a film called <i><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3RpxPtB\">Mozart's Sister film</a></i>, which attempted to show the life of Nannerl with speculations of what her early life could've looked like. Of course, that is really impossible to know because so little has been documented specifically about her life, though reviews claim the film to be very well-made. It does do an amazing job bringing Nannerl into the spotlight. The play initially hit venues across the world in 2015 and there probably aren't any showings anytime soon because of the pandemic, though I'm going to keep my eye out for it.</p>\n<p>There is also a book by the same title, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3JufgCP\">Mozart's Sister Book</a>, which is appropriate for young readers as well.</p>\n<p>It's truly a travesty that the stories of extraordinary women of the past in the book of history tend to be left unturned and subjected to erosion. Such is the case with Nannerl Mozart. It's refreshing to see recent attempts to recollect and remember her life's story. With the musicianship and pedigree of talent she possessed, she deserves recognition.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<div class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<div class=\"byline post-share-buttons goog-inline-block\"> </div>\n</div>\n</div>",

The character Hailey Rutledge is based after Tindall, who is a new oboist dying to get into the symphony. The rest of the cast is put together splendidly, offering great depth in the film. </p>\n<p><br>Well this is...fun?<br><br>How many of you were excited to go to music class in your younger years so you could have fun playing music, laugh with your friends, and relax from the typical classroom setting; only to find out you had to watch a boring documentary on a classical musician, and take notes? Or is that just me? <br><br>Thankfully, Mozart in the Jungle is different. It is of course a show, and not completely factual, but there is still plenty to get out of it, without taking notes and falling asleep every scene. The characters show emotion, the symphony is struggling financially, some are having identity crises; everything is real.  <br><br><br><br>Women Classical Musicians Exist?<br><br>Not only do women musicians exist, but they often don’t get as much recognition as male musicians. It’s not because women don’t want to or simply don’t play, but there is still a huge rift in the music world when it comes to gender equality.<br><br>That being said, I was quite excited that Mozart in the Jungle spent as much time on the female characters as it did on the males. Although it’s only fair, as the show is based off of a woman’s piece of work; but the media being the media, they could have easily skewed that aspect. <br><br>Hailey starts off as Rodrigo’s assistant, spending a lot of time making the conductor’s tea. Hailey becomes an equal star in the show over time, and takes control over her identity; something I’m sure all musicians can relate to at some point in their lives and careers. <br>________________________________________________________________<br><br>Most shows, documentaries, or books about classical music are stiff and almost lifeless. Mozart in the Jungle shows the lives of a musician outside of their art; because after all, they do have one. If you would like to experience the raw, humorous, and captivating show that is Mozart in the Jungle, check out the trailer!</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QixpBQcGAqc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>And get to practicing, we all know how inspired we get by entertainment films!</p>",

No matter what our mother tongue is, we can all but impacted in the same way by the same kind of music regardless of the language that piece of music is sung in or derived from. Not only can the aforementioned sentiment be attributed to people across the world, but we can apply it to animals as well. It's no surprise that animals have the ability to respond to music; there have been many studies conducted to prove it as well. For example, a 2001 study at the University of Leicester found that cows tend to produce more milk when listening to slower music. In another example, a 2012 study done at Emory University found that the parts in a bird's brain that react when listening to music is similar to the parts of a human's brain that reacts as well. I can go on and on about more fascinating studies because they are all really quite interesting. However, in this post, I'm going to specifically be talking about one animal in particular, the elephant. </p>\n<p>The elephant is quite the intelligent creature. Its memory is practically unrivaled, it has shown the ability to use tools and can distinguish different human languages. With a brain like that, elephants has expressed a keen aptitude for listening to human music. Just take the Thai Elephant Orchestra as a prime example of this. Musician and neuroscientist Dave Soldier along with conversationalist Richard Lair founded this orchestra back in 2000, which features up to 16 elephants playing instruments specifically made for them such as steel drums or harmonicas. You can read more about the founders and the orchestra via this <a href=\"http://davesoldier.com/thaiorch.html\">link</a>. Personally I thought stuff like this only existed inside the pages of a picture book, yet here I am amazed and sorely mistaken. We are going to venture back to Thailand to talk about the amazing story of Paul Barton and his elephants.</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i1qQOGCyRbY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Barton's career in the arts started at the age of 16, but not the type of arts you'd initially think. He studied arts at the Royal Academy of Arts in London and one prizes in portrait painting and portrait drawing in student competitions and would soon have his work exhibited at various exhibitions. Despite his early success with portrait art, he decided to make a career out of being a concert pianist. His career started off strong with many great performances to his name, though he quickly decided that it wasn't the life that he wanted. This career change led him to travel to Thailand where he taught piano at the Thai Piano School; he would also go on to meet his future wife there as well and decided begin a new life there. On his 50th birthday, his wife asked him what it is he'd like to do and that was when this fascinating story began. He decided he wanted to play piano for elephants.</p>\n<p>Thailand was infamous for subjecting elephants to hard labor, specifically logging. After deforestation was declared illegal a number of years ago, those elephants were set free from their lives of arduous labors. Many of those elephants were of old age, injured or handicapped and would end up at Elephant's World, a safe haven for these elephants that offer them a place to recover and relax. Barton decided that these elephants needed more than just an open space to relax and took it upon himself to offer his services to these wounded animals. His first client was an elephant named Plara, who's work in logging caused her to go blind and was tossed aside like nothing after she was no longer useful. Barton recalled his previous work with blind children and how music impacted them and applied this to Plara, playing the piano live for her. Plara had been in the middle of eating (and elephants will eat to no avail), but when Barton started playing some Beethoven, Plara stopped eating just to enjoy the music.</p>\n<p>This was the start of his YouTube channel, which to this date has amassed over 540k subscribers. A lot of his content involves piano playing and portrait painting, but his most popular content by far is when he posts videos of him out in the open with a piano comforting a handicapped elephant. It's definitely interesting to watch the interactions between Barton and the elephants, especially given the PTSD the elephants must be suffering at the hands of humans. Elephants can be violent and with the way humans have treated these creatures, they should have resentment towards humans  Because of this history, Barton makes it a point of emphasis to move the piano all the way to where the elephants are (which is in the mountains), just to comfort them. \"What is the little thing I can do as a human to say sorry, for my species for what we have done to them?,\" Barton said. \"I'll carry this heavy thing myself and play some music for the elephant while it is having some breakfast.</p>\n<p>Barton is truly a kind soul and the work that he's doing is altruistic and amazing. I highly encourage that you check out his YouTube channel and see his interactions with elephants for yourself. You can see it all <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/PaulBartonThailand/videos\">here</a>. I'm glad that these elephants have Barton, after the life they've endured, it's the least they deserve.</p>",

One of the most famous jazz musicians of all time, she was best know for her powerful vocal musicality and ability to improvise on the spot, an essential skill for any jazz musician. Today, we'll go over the extraordinary life and legacy of Billie Holiday.</p>\n<p>Billie Holiday was born on April 7, 1915 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Billie Holiday wasn't her birth given name though and there's a lot of confusion regarding her original name (some sources say Elinore Harris, others say Eleanora Fagan). Holiday was a result of a teenage pregnancy and unfortunately, her father wasn't around much when she was growing up. Though, her father was believed to be Clarence Holiday, who grew up to become a great jazz musician himself. I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree given where Billie ended up in her career.</p>\n<p>Her childhood didn't get any easier. Her mother, Sadie, would marry another man when she was just 5 years old, but he would end up leaving them to struggle a few years later. Billie would also choose to skip school and her and her mother were forced to go to court regarding her truancy. Billie would wind up at a facility for troubled African American girls at the age of 9. She returned to her mother's custody that same year, but would then be a victim of sexual assault just the next year. Despite all the hardship she's had to endure in her early childhood, she found comfort in music, especially Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith. </p>\n<p>Her singing career would begin at the age of 15, where she would sing at local clubs to put herself and her voice out there. This is around the same time she decided to take up the new name \"Billie\". At age 18, she would be discovered by producer John Hammond while she was singing at a Harlem jazz club. Hammond joined Holiday with rising musician Benny Goodman and with him, she would sing the vocals for various tracks. This would skyrocket her career as she would continue to collaborate with other jazz musicians. After joining Count Basie's orchestra, saxophonist Lester Young would give her the nickname \"Lady Day\", a moniker that she would be remembered by. She would then join Artie Shaw's orchestra, making history as the first female African American vocalist to work with a white orchestra. Though, the professional relationship wouldn't last long as unfortunately, promoters would ridicule her for her race and she would end up leaving the orchestra.</p>\n<p>She continued to be censored for her heritage in the music business. Columbia Records helped Holiday to debut arguably two of her most famous songs: \"God Bless the Child\" and \"Strange Fruit\". However, Columbia had no plans to produce \"Strange Fruit\" because of its underlying story about the lynching of African Americans in the South. She would instead record this song with the Commodore label and because of the controversy behind it, it would actually make the song even more famous. \"Strange Fruit\" would also gain even more notoriety as the song that the Federal Bureau of Narcotics tried to silence in conjunction with her narcotic issues. The commissioner of the FBN, Harry Anslinger, would go on to claim that her heroin addiction made \"Strange Fruit\" a dangerous song to release in the public. However, Anslinger was known to be racist and many people say Anslinger's motives to be derived from his hate for African American as opposed to Holiday's drug issues.</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dnlTHvJBeP0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IQlehVpcAes\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"post-body-container\">\n<div id=\"post-body-7120867020807585900\" class=\"post-body entry-content float-container\">\n<p>She was at the peak of her fame, but tragically it was cut short due to her own fatal choices. She was known to be a heavy drinker, and after marrying James Monroe in 1941, would pick up on smoking opium as well. While the marriage didn't last, her addiction to drugs did. She would start using heroin after meeting her next boyfriend and her drug and alcohol intake would only increase after the death of her mother in 1945. Even though her life would come full circle when she got the opportunity to share the big screen with one of her idols Louis Armstrong in the film <i>New Orleans</i> in 1947 and she continued touring throughout the 1950's, her drug and alcohol dependence finally caught up with her in 1959. She was arrested multiple times for possession of narcotics in the 50s, even once getting arrested after being admitted to the hospital for heart and liver issues. Holiday would succumb to drug and alcohol complications on July 17, 1959, an unfortunate death far too common among successful celebrities.</p>\n<p>Her music and legacy is still felt to this day. Her autobiography, <i></i><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3WMOatu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Lady Sings the Blues</i> </a>(which she reportedly did not read herself) was written with the help of William Dufty and would be turned into a film of the same name in 1972, which featured Diana Ross playing the late Billie Holiday. Holiday would also be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000. Even as recent as 2021, Holiday's legacy is felt as Hulu released <i>The United States Vs. Billie Holiday</i>, a film that specifically covered her debacle with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics regarding \"Strange Fruit\". The actress who played Holiday in the film, Andra Day, would win the Golden Globe for best actress in a drama in February 2021 and be honored by the Black Women Film Network for her tremendous job in the role. This is a great thing to see and I'm so glad that Holiday's memory is still very much with us, even more than 50 years later. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<div class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<div class=\"byline post-share-buttons goog-inline-block\"> </div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Hildegard Von Bingen, also known as Saint Hildegard, was a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedictine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Benedictine </a>Abbess, the head of the nuns. On top of her devoted Catholic life, Hildegard was also known for her writing, philosophy, visions, and musical compositions. <br><br>Hildegard was born in or around 1098 in the Rhineland, now Western Germany, to lower nobility parents. At the age of 8-14, her parents offered her as an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">oblate</a>, a person dedicated to serving God, which officially began her life in the religious sector. <br><br>From an early age, Hildegard reported visions, or what she called \"the reflection of the living light\". She believed that these visions were God talking to her through her five senses, and she later took a vision into interpretation to begin her writings.  </p>\n<h3>Musical Life</h3>\n<p>Hildegard's most popular composition is <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordo_Virtutum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ordo Virtutum</a></i>, Latin for \"Order of the Virtues\", a Latin mortality play that is comprised of 82 songs. Although the exact date is not known for certain, it's believed that this composition was released in 1151, making her the first woman composer in Western music. Ordo Virtutum is known to be the oldest surviving musical drama that is not attached to a liturgy, a public worship by a religious group. Take a listen to the Hildegard's most famous work below, which showcases the allegory of the Christian story, portrayed by the struggle between 16 Virtues and the Devil over the destiny of the female soul.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/26/Hildegard_von_Bingen_-_De_Spiritu_Santo.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"938\" height=\"552\"></figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Symphonia/OVlxDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Symphonia Armoniae Celestium Revelationum</a>,</i> a collection of 77 of Hildegard's liturgical songs, offer her views on her world at the time through hymns, antiphons, responsories, and sequences. While it is clear she was following classic and contemporary chanting styles in this collection, she pushed the musical boundaries of her time, offering something new that her community could sing along to. <br><br>For a women who claimed to be uneducated, Hildegard sure did spend a lot of time educating her community through music, as well as advocating for more freedom for the nuns she oversaw. Women were seen as far weaker than men in the 12th Century, and were never given the chance to be listened to, but by using her role as an Abbess, her words were heard more than any women in her time. Hildegard was officially recognized and labeled as a Saint in 2012 by Pope Benedict XVI. From the mouth of Saint Hildegard herself, \"woman may be made from man, but no man is made without a woman.\"<br><br>For more information on Hildegard's music and writings, I highly recommend you check out <a href=\"http://www.hildegard-society.org/p/music.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this </a>article and resource.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Breaking news out of New Orleans came recently when city officials announced on March 10th that live music would be making a return to venues such as bars and concert halls starting the 12th, marking the first time live music will officially be back in the US since COVID forced closures of such venues worldwide. It seems that the introduction of the vaccine has helped with the gradual reopening of certain places and activities that were completely ravished by the threat of the virus, namely sports arenas opening to a reduced percent of full capacity and now with these aforementioned venues allowing for love music. While this is a huge step as we try to claw ourselves back to normalcy as a society, let's take a step back and examine this decision and what it entails. </p>\n<p>Despite these openings, public places must still adhere to the state guidelines in terms of capacity. In Louisiana: 75% capacity is allowed in restaurants, salons, movie theaters, museums and offices. 50% capacity allowed in bars, breweries, gyms, fitness centers and conference venues. 75% capacity with a 250 max in concert and music halls with fixed permanent seating. And of course, masks are still required. new Orleans seems to be in a good position to allow for live music, as its COVID positivity rate is down to 1.5% when it was as high as 10.4% 3 months ago and around 21.4% of its residents have received at least one vaccine dose.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/25/pexels-clem-onojeghuo-375893.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1252\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/25/responsive/pexels-clem-onojeghuo-375893-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/25/responsive/pexels-clem-onojeghuo-375893-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/25/responsive/pexels-clem-onojeghuo-375893-md.jpeg 768w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/25/responsive/pexels-clem-onojeghuo-375893-lg.jpeg 1024w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/25/responsive/pexels-clem-onojeghuo-375893-xl.jpeg 1360w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/25/responsive/pexels-clem-onojeghuo-375893-2xl.jpeg 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>There was also a new set of rules introduced for live musicians based on what instrument they will be playing. Pianists and string instrument musicians have just have to abide by the typical mask mandate and six feet of social distancing. However, if you're a wind or brass musician, a whole new set of rules is in play. Wind and brass musicians are required to wear face masks with openings specifically catering the the shape of the mouthpiece of their respective instruments. Those instruments must be fitted with a bell cover whenever it is outside of its case. Wind and brass musicians must also sit an extended nine feet apart from each other. Additionally, open mics and karaoke or any other activities that would encourage patrons to partake in the music are still prohibited. Arguably, the biggest restriction that came with the reintroduction of live music is that dancing for patrons is not allowed.</p>\n<p>I'm a huge advocate for protecting our musicians who are performing live music, as everyone should, and it's finally great that after a tumultuous year for musicians that they're getting their first big break. However, I'm not sure how I feel about requiring wind and brass musicians to wear a mask while playing their instruments and simply having a hole in the mask that fits the mouthpiece. A mask with a hole is practically useless, especially a hole sizable enough to fit a mouthpiece. Given social distancing parameters in place, those musicians should be able to freely play their instruments without a mask hindering them in any way; if patrons are eating food without creating a hole in their masks then the same can be said for these instrumentalists. I think the thought process behind that mandate is good-rooted and is meant to prioritize the health of our musicians, which is of the utmost importance in this situation. My only concern about that rule is that during the times they are on stage and not playing, will they be forced to wear their masks with the hole in it or will they have separate functioning masks with them? It would make much more sense for them to have singular hole-less masks on their persons that they can freely put on and take off depending on if they're playing or not. I think having them wear masks while playing gives off the a pseudo-safety impression when in actuality a hole-less mask offers virtually no protection. And the concern about musicians potentially infecting patrons is addressed already by requiring bell covers on the instruments at all times when they are out of their cases. It's a challenging concept to address, but I personally think it can be changed to make our musicians safer. </p>\n<p>Also, it's unfortunate that patrons won't be able to fully immerse themselves in the music since they won't be allowed to dance, though I 100% agree with that decision for the safety of both patrons and musicians.</p>\n<p>We should pay attention to how New Orleans handles this and how the COVID rates are impacted there. Its success (or failure) could be contingent on other cities' abilities to offer live music once again. The city's seems to be focusing hard on keeping everyone safe with this new reintroduction of live music and I think they can manage it well and set a standard for other cities to follow. Only time will tell, so let's hope for the best.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I know that all throughout Women's History Month we've been covering those most historical women in music history, those who have pioneered the field and laid down the groundwork for generations to come. Today, I would like to switch things up a bit and talk about an astounding and award-winning contemporary female composer that is a part of the future generations set forth by those we have covered already. I'll be covering the musical career of Unsuk Chin.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Early Life and Growing Up</strong></p>\n<p>Chin was born in Seoul, South Korea in 1961 to a Christian household, her father had even been a Presbyterian minister at the time. In said Christian household, Chin, along with her three other siblings, were forced to abide by strict religious rules and social ranks. Because of this, according to Chin herself, there existed a culture at home where her parents weren't interested in what she was doing, even to the point of not knowing what classes she was taking. Thus, her pursuit of music was one that was completely voluntary and of her own volition. At an early age, she discovered a love for piano and would play for religious services while self-teaching that instrument itself as well as music theory. </p>\n<p>Her love of music led her to discovering music off of the radio, specifically Western music such as Tchaikovsky and Beethoven. Chin had sought to continue a career in music, but was met with a large hurdle where she failed her university entrance exams twice. Her failures can be attributed to her lack of knowledge in how to present herself and the behaviors that would make her a good candidate, mostly due to the home culture she had grown up in. Alas, she would go onto the study music composition at Seoul National University under the tutelage of composer Sukhi Kang, who is regarded as the master of contemporary Korean music.</p>\n<p><strong>Professional Studies</strong></p>\n<p>Despite having spent her entire life up to this point in South Korea, Chin was encouraged to move to Germany to continue her studies. Kang's mentors had reasoned that it was difficult for women to carve out a successful in Korea as it was regarded as a dictatorship at the time, though around the 1980s, restrictions on air travel lightened up and Chin was encouraged to take advantage of that. Taking up that sound advice and using an academic grant she earned, she would make her way to Hamburg, Germany to study under György Ligeti, described as \"one of the most important avant-garde composers in the latter half of the 20th century\". During her studies with him, she realized that tough love was his way to teaching and he was one to keep things real. He would make comments regarding Chin's first compositions, stating that they were not completely hers, which was true to a certain extend as she had help from some of her contemporaries at the time. This caused her to give up composing for some time, though Ligeti made it clear to her that he always believed that she was very gifted.</p>\n<p><strong>Professional Career and Awards</strong></p>\n<p>Her first profession gig was in 1989 when she worked as a freelance composer at an electronic music studio of the Technical University of Berlin. There, she would produce many of her first pieces, and arguably the piece that would help her breakthrough the scene: <i>Acrostic Wordplay</i>. That piece alone would be performed in various countries throughout North America, Europe and Asia. She would continue to collaborate with multiple ensembles and orchestras, consistently gaining notoriety and it would eventually lead her to a partnership with Boosey &amp; Hawkes, known to be the largest specialist classical music publisher in the world. Her works would then continue to featured by some of the most famous orchestras in the world such as the New York Philharmonic, Chicago Philharmonic and the Berlin Philharmonic. She would also establish a strong connection to the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra for 11 years and along with the composer-in-residence Myung-Whun Chung, would found the Ars Nova Series for contemporary music. That initiative would present many Korean premieres of contemporary music. Chin also took a jab at opera scores, producing an operatic adaptation of <i>Alice in Wonderland </i>based on the novels in 2007 alongside Asian-American playwright David Henry Hwang.</p>\n<p>Chin would be recognized for many of her works, receiving a plethora of awards during her musical career. Some notable awards include the University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for her Violin Concerto in 2004, the Kyung-Ahm Prize in 2007 and most recently the Léonie Sonning Music Prize in 2021. Of note, her Cello Concerto (2009) was regarded at the \"11th greatest work of art music since 200\" by <i>The Guardian</i>.</p>\n<p>She is currently still very much involved in the music industry and is currently overseeing the Ars Nova Series of the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra as well as serving as the artistic director of the Music of Today series at the London Philharmonia Orchestra since 2011.</p>\n<p>Feel free to check out some of her award wining works! </p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"320\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZgXnvVDTDEY\" title=\"Unsuk Chin - Acrostic Wordplay\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"320\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3WejQFPTG3E\" title=\"'Alice in Wonderland' by Unsuk Chin\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p> </p>",
