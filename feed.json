The two have deep ties though, thanks to the art of sampling.<br><br>Sampling is the act of reusing a portion of a sound recording in another recording, usually in terms of songs, but the sampled sound bite can come from just about anywhere. It's a practice that has been around since the 1970s, and if you have a broad music knowledge or a good ear, I'm sure you can catch sampling in everyday life. And Classical music isn't a genre Hip-Hop leaves untouched. </p>\n<h3><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/20/pexels-aleksandr-neplokhov-1238980.jpeg\" alt=\"Rap battle \" width=\"3089\" height=\"2048\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/20/responsive/pexels-aleksandr-neplokhov-1238980-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/20/responsive/pexels-aleksandr-neplokhov-1238980-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/20/responsive/pexels-aleksandr-neplokhov-1238980-md.jpeg 768w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/20/responsive/pexels-aleksandr-neplokhov-1238980-lg.jpeg 1024w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/20/responsive/pexels-aleksandr-neplokhov-1238980-xl.jpeg 1360w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/20/responsive/pexels-aleksandr-neplokhov-1238980-2xl.jpeg 1600w\"></figure></h3>\n<h3>O Fortuna Meets Hate Me Now</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Orff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Carl Orff</a>, a German composer, applied music to the centuries old \"O Fortuna\", a poem from Medieval Times, in 1935.

Sure, the message and overall mood of the song can drastically change. But some of the greatest producers in Hip-Hop became, and continue to be, inspired by Classical music. This gives a recognition to the Classical genre that might not otherwise exist if sampling wasn't as well practiced as it is. We're all guilty in some aspect to sticking to the music we know and enjoy most, but sampling creates a bridge between genres for those willing to look deeper.<br><br>For a great list of Hip-Hop songs along with their Classical counterparts, visit this <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2NiuNL14IOxpfs7oKODTPG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spotify playlist</a>.

At eighteen in 1942, along with her friend Doris Robinson, the pair entered into a contest at the <a href=\"https://www.apollotheaters.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apollo Theater</a>, for their Amateur Night. Robinson did the singing, while Vaughan was the piano accompaniment. The duo won second place, only lighting more fire under Sarah. <br><br>Vaughan came back to Amateur Night and competed by herself, singing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_and_Soul_(song)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Body and Soul</a>. And she won; earning $10 and a week's engagement at the Apollo. Her first act came in opening for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ella_Fitzgerald\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ella Fitzgerald</a>, another prominent jazz singer of the time. <br><br>It goes without saying that someone is going to pick up on talent when you're singing at the Apollo Theater for an entire week. And that's just what happened for Sarah. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Hines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Earl Hines</a>, a jazz pianist and bandleader, credits himself with discovering Vaughan and her talent. He claims he offered her a job on the spot, although details are disputed with his male singer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Eckstine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Billy Eckstine</a>. Nonetheless, Vaughan replaced Hines' female singer in 1943.<br><br>Sarah toured with Hines' band up until late into the next year, before joining Eckstine's band that was created as an offshoot. This gave her the perfect opportunity to record for the first time; listen to<i> I'll Wait and Pray</i> below. Soon afterwards she left the band and began her solo journey. </p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0m9wd3NoZpQ\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<h3>Solo Career</h3>\n<div>Sarah continued to play at local nightclubs, such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_Society\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Café Society</a>, and gained recognition. In 1945 she was invited to record <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWtLRLeM26U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Time and Again</a></i> by Stuff Smith, a violinist, and was offered a recording contract with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musicraft_Records\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Musicraft </a>by Albert Marx, the owner.</div>\n<div><br>While spending time in the Café Society, Sarah met and befriended George Treadwell, a trumpeter. He ended up becoming her manager, and husband in 1946. <br><br>In this time Vaughan became known as \"Sassy\" and \"The Divine One\" for her musical talent and performance energy. <br><br>Vaughan was recording and releasing loads of music in her time, and she bounced from record label to record label. Some of her most recognized songs include <i>Broken Hearted Melody</i>, <i>If You Could See Me Now</i>, and <i>Smooth Operator</i>. <br><br>While Sarah and George's marriage didn't last, Vaughan's success stuck with her to her death in 1990. Sarah was diagnosed with lung cancer, and passed away at age 66, watching Laker Girls, a TV show featuring her daughter, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0891088/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Paris Vaughan</a>.</div>\n<p><br>Check out this video of Sarah Vaughan from 1969 singing scat blues.</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/u51fdqvcs5A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Awards and Achievements </h3>\n<p>Vaughan's first award came in 1947, with Esquire's New Star Award. Following that, she won awards from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downbeat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Down Beat</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metronome_(magazine)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Metronome</a>. On top of those, her album <i>Sarah Vaughan with Clifford Brown</i>, along with the single <i>If You Could See Me Now </i>(see the song below) were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Vaughan has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, is a member of the American Jazz Hall of Fame and the New Jersey Hall of Fame, and has an Honorary Doctorate of Music at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berklee_College_of_Music\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Berklee College of Music.</a></p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lJXLqAutql4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Sarah Vaughan is another example of woman excellence in the musical world. From her numerous awards, to her large <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/artist/8284-Sarah-Vaughan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">discography</a>, she was beyond successful. And like so many of her peers, it's as if she was born to sing and perform. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Image Source: This work is from the William P. Gottlieb collection at the Library of Congress.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>With the month of April being Jazz Appreciation Month, I thought I'd dive into the genre of jazz and look at the unique and weird aspect of it. I thought to myself that since jazz is predicated on improvisation and is one of the more free-flowing genres out there, surely some jazz musicians have experimented with using different instruments that are not typically known to be jazz instruments in their music. In my research, I found some fascinated artists. Rufus Harvey took the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq1kVLHxCQA\">bagpipes</a> and created some hot jazz tunes with the odd instrument. Dorothy Ashby is revered for her inclusion of the harp into jazz and her landmark piece <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GFAs29DR-A\">Afro-Harping</a></i>. Steve Turre is best known for being a trombonist, but he also carries around a variety of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2009/12/17/121557360/steve-turre-at-yoshis-with-pharoah-sanders\">conch shells</a> that he's drilled holes into to turn them into instruments. While turning conch shells into musical instruments is ambitious and really out-there, I found a completely new instrument that I hadn't heard of before that really caught my eye.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/DaxoTongues.jpg\" alt=\"Daxophone Instrument\" width=\"702\" height=\"527\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<p>I would certainly understand if you're a bit confused right now. You might've looked at the title of this article that thought I made a grave spelling error, I mean the saxophone is one of the most popular instruments in jazz. And then you look at the picture of some wooden contraction I've provided and now you might be even more confused, especially because you might assume that by the presence of a bow that this is a string instrument and you'd kind of be right? I'll try to explain this instrument as best I can. Let me introduce you to the Daxophone.</p>\n<p>The daxophone is a relatively new instrument, invented by Hans Reichel in 1987. Though the instrument itself may look a bit confusing, Reichel said, \"The basic principle of this instrument can't be more simple; it's a tongue, as well as a ruler at the end of a table.\" When it was first invented, the daxophone looked a lot more rudimentary, as seen here. There are four parts that make up this odd instruments: tongue, bow, dax and soundbox. The tongue is the wooden slab that you see protruding out from the instrument; this is the main sound producing part and is what the bow makes contact with. The bow itself is the same as your typical violin bow from my estimation. The dax is a little curved wooden thing that is separate from the instrument that is applied to the tongue to adjust the pitch, it can be seen towards the bottom of the first picture. The soundbox is what sits underneath the tongue and amplifies the vibrations, can be electronic to be then plugged into an amp.</p>\n<p>To play the daxophone, I think it would be best to show a video than if I just tried to explain it myself.</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"320\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TZLL5Jxbdxw\" title=\"Daxophone Demonstration\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>As you can see, the bow is used to make contact with the tongue while the dax is applied to different areas along the tongue to generate different pitches. Also, the instrument makes quite an interesting sound, very unique from any conventional instrument, and some of it's sounds even sound like human hums! Sounds are not only influenced by the positioning of the bow and dax against the tongue, but the shape of the tongue itself as the tongue is detachable. Also, it's not too difficult to actually make one of these tongues so it could be even more personalized, which I think is a really cool concept for an instrument.</p>\n<p>When it comes to jazz, Reichel himself took his own instrument and decided to inject it into the world of jazz. Reichel has since put out multiple albums that feature his daxophone and while not all of his albums are embedded in jazz, many of his compositions can be characterized as jazz. I'd say most of those pieces come from his album <i>Yuxo: A New Daxophone Operetta</i>, and I'd highly recommend checking out the piece <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0FAZQ5O3Vs&amp;list=PLfLRqHhT6TTxXm2URLKl_RZsVurOvsZ8v&amp;index=10\">Le Bal (New Version)</a></i>, which I think is the piece that is the most jazzy out of the bunch. Though, if you really want to check out the range of the daxophone and how it came be played in different ways, why not listen to the whole album! I'm not sure if the daxophone will ever become a mainstream instrument, but it's certainly one of the most unique instruments out there.</p>",

When I was in elementary school, I'll admit that one of the only reasons why I looked forward to science class was because every so often my teacher would put on <i>Bill Nye the Science Guy, </i>an educational show with an iconic title song, unique style of conveying information and a memorable character the in titular man himself, Bill Nye. I loved to tune into his shows while in class as he taught me about the different phases of matter, the planets and photosynthesis. The show is quite outdated though as its debut was almost two decades ago; I wonder if other forms of media have come out to attempt to combine science with fun. As I asked this question, I discovered an ambitious project that not only combined fun and science, but did so with music.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/16/cranium-gca088ae47_1280.png\" alt=\"Brain Outline filled with music notes\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1073\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/16/responsive/cranium-gca088ae47_1280-xs.png 300w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/16/responsive/cranium-gca088ae47_1280-sm.png 480w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/16/responsive/cranium-gca088ae47_1280-md.png 768w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/16/responsive/cranium-gca088ae47_1280-lg.png 1024w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/16/responsive/cranium-gca088ae47_1280-xl.png 1360w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/16/responsive/cranium-gca088ae47_1280-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<div> </div>\n<div><i>Science Fair</i> is not your typical opera, as you'd probably guessed by the title of it. Mezzo-soprano Hai-Ting Chinn along with pianist Erika Switzer came together and the brainchild of their collaboration became a combination of two school subjects on different ends of the spectrum, creating an opera based entirely in science education. Think of her as having taken some inspiration from what Bill Nye once laid the groundwork for years ago in teaching science and making it fun. Save for the wacky sound effects that Nye coveted to much, Chinn utilizes her powerful and soothing voice as well as physical demonstrations to introduce certain science topics from your typical baking soda volcano to explaining away DNA. She also adds in some light-hearted humor which would seem to pay homage to Nye's show.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>According to Chinn, the 80-minute masterpiece came of her interest in both music and science and she sought to combine them. Chinn was clearly very dedicated to the arts and her degrees speak for themselves; she obtained her Bachelor of Music from the esteemed Eastman School of Music and then her Master of Music in Voice and Opera from Yale University. You may be asking where her interest in the sciences came from, and you'd be surprised to hear that it's really been with her ever since she was born. Her mother was a mathematics professor at Humboldt State University and has been very vocal about involving into STEM, though at the time it was a very much under-the-radar cause. Chinn admired her mother's passion for \"girls in STEM\" and has always seen science as a source of fun. Chinn would make following advancements in science a hobby while music dominated as a full-time profession. As her involvement in both fields grew, she was dismayed by a realization she came upon, that there was little music out there that celebrated the wonders of the science world. It would seem that <i>Science Fair</i> was a way to pioneer a path that hopefully other musicians will follow.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Though an audacious endeavor, it was met with great reviews, as critics reveled in Chinn's almost seamless combination of science and music. They also commended her command of the information and how well it was conveyed, especially to a younger audience. They too, hope that this will lay the groundwork for further great works that blend science and music.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>The opera itself is meant to appeal to younger audiences. According to Chinn, the project is meant to \"stimulate the childlike delight in discovery that she remembers from her past.\" The way science topics are introduced in the performance is also clearly phrased in a way to cater to younger people. If there were a digital recording of the performance, I'd love to see it being shown in elementary classrooms as I certainly believe that it would help to engage more children in learning. Chinn has started that she plans to shift to the digital format because of the pandemic as her plans to tour last year were hampered by the pandemic. The last stream of the performance was back on March 6th and I'm not sure when the next one will be, but I'll surely be on the lookout. In lieu of the full performance, I've included a long-form video of excerpts from the opera alongside an interview with Chinn herself about the project. I highly recommend checking it out; hearing her talking about how she came about this idea, how it was formulated and her reflecting on her performance is amazing to see.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"320\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B7awHQUDuDM\" title=\"Opera, Science, Solar System, Solo Arts Heal Hai-Ting Chinn\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></div>",

This costs streamers $9.99 a month, a small price to pay for unlimited streams, playlist capabilities, and the ridding of advertisements. <br><br>While Spotify offers this Premium option, artists are only getting paid between <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-does-spotify-pay-per-stream\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$0.003 and $0.005</a> per stream. With large following bases, this can be enough, but for newer artists, and artists of less streamed genres, the service can be difficult to make revenue off of. <br><br>With this unfortunate reality, longer songs, such as hour(s) long Classical songs still get paid that fraction of a penny, even if a listener makes it to the end of the piece. This small payment directly impacts musicians, a disincentive for longer pieces. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/15/pexels-zx-teoh-8143724.jpeg\" alt=\"iPhone with music streaming\" width=\"3744\" height=\"5616\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/15/responsive/pexels-zx-teoh-8143724-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/15/responsive/pexels-zx-teoh-8143724-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/15/responsive/pexels-zx-teoh-8143724-md.jpeg 768w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/15/responsive/pexels-zx-teoh-8143724-lg.jpeg 1024w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/15/responsive/pexels-zx-teoh-8143724-xl.jpeg 1360w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/15/responsive/pexels-zx-teoh-8143724-2xl.jpeg 1600w\"></figure>\n<h3>The Classical Spotify</h3>\n<p>2014 born <a href=\"https://www.primephonic.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Primephonic</a>, essentially the Spotify for Classical music, is creating musical standards of its own. The streaming service created by a team of Dutch/Americans aims to serve the Classical music world. Unlike Spotify, however, the service doesn't have a free streaming option. The company states in their FAQ section that music is simply not free and \"advertisements can be highly damaging to classical music if an opera or symphony with gapless playback is interrupted.\"</p>\n<h3>For the People (Aka Musicians)</h3>\n<div>While Spotify is known for \"underpaying\" its' artists, Primephonic runs off of what they call \"<a href=\"https://www.primephonic.com/payout-model?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Fair Pay Model</a>\". The service reminds us that hour long pieces take more time, effort, and money to produce and record than typical three minute songs, so the payout to artists should reflect that hard work. <br><br>The Fair Pay Model pays artists per second streamed, rather than the amount of times streamed. This generates a fair payment based on the length of song, and how long a listener chooses to stream the piece. Primephonic includes a quote that sums up the values of the Classical music streaming service; \"We want to pay classical music artists more fairly to encourage their creative freedom.\"<br><br>For $9.99 a month for the Premium version, and $14.99 a month for the higher sound quality Platinum plan, Primephonic offers a great deal to Classical music streamers and artists alike. <br><br>\n<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>\n<div>It's no secret that musicians aren't always paid enough for their hard work, that's why the term \"struggling artist\" exists. Spotify is a great resource for music lovers to discover new music, but is it exploiting its' artists? </div>\n</div>",

Grant they are much smaller that we are, I'm referring to their lack of sight that is compensated by their hypersensitive sense of touch. Spiders rely on tiny hairs that encompass the majority of their bodies and legs to familiarize themselves with their environments. In addition, the webs they weave to catch prey compliments their powerful sense of touch as spiders are able to differentiate visitors on their webs based on the different vibrations produced on the web. So a spider would be able to tell if an unfortunate fly got caught or another fellow spider had come for a visit.</p>\n<p>Given a spider's reliance on their sense of touch and advanced perception of vibrations, scientists reasoned that it would be possible to understand how to spiders communicate with each other if we could understand the vibrations produced in their webs. According to head scientist of the scientific endeavor Markus Buehler, \"The spider lives in an environment of vibrating strings, they sense their world through vibrations, which have different frequencies.\" While the frequencies on these webs are felt by the spider, scientists scanned the webs with lasers, translated them into a two-dimensional image, created a three-dimensional network of webs and then assigned sound frequencies to different strands to create a full \"musical piece\". I didn't know what to expect when listening to these spider web frequencies, but I couldn't have imaged that it would sound like that. In short, it sounds like something straight out of a nightmare. Feel free to check it out here, but fair warning that it is really odd.</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"320\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s4QtAQhdU2I\" title=\"Spider web sonification: Less busy music, sonification of the porous web along z-axis\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>If you checked it out, kind of creepy right? If you have a virtual reality system, you'd be able to really immerse yourself in a spider's world. The scientists created a VR program based on their findings called <i>Spider's Canvas</i>, which allows people to not only hear the music of spider vibrations but to also interact with the web strands to help people better understand how spiders see the world. </p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"320\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HL_MHD93wFc\" title=\"Spider web sonification: Virtual Reality (VR) explorations\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"separator\">With these advances in their studies, scientists have been able to characterize certain vibrations into different categories such as wind, prey and fellow spider. Scientists are hoping that this sparks the development of communication with spiders, which is really an interesting prospect.</div>\n<div class=\"separator\"> </div>\n<div class=\"separator\">Buehler also believes that it would be really interesting to see if this \"spider music\" could be the groundwork for a new genre of music, stating that \"webs could be a new source for musical inspiration that is very different from the usual human experience.\" It's no surprising to hear Buehler talking about music in science like this, as he's known to be very invested in incorporating music into science. He's used similar technologies in the sonification of the <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-275864738/mrna-music-pfizer-and-moderna-vaccine\">Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines</a> to show the subtle difference between the two. He also did the same thing with two COVID-19 variants.</div>\n<div class=\"separator\"> </div>\n<div class=\"separator\">I think the idea that music is the universal language is such an interesting concept and the ways that us humans continue to extend the meaning behind that claim is really quite amazing. I wonder how far we will come in communication with spiders and what other animals we may be able to talk to with the power of music.</div>",

Not only is there science that backs up the fact that incorporating music in teaching other subjects helps students to absorb the material more easily, but it also helps to engage students even more and makes the learning process fun. It makes sense why a lot of children's programs constantly include music regularly, such as Peppa Pig and The Wiggles. Music tends to help develop a child's literacy by introducing new words to them in the form of song and helping to embed both the word and meaning into the child's mind. In this post, I'm going to be focusing on how certain music games can help children physically, specifically in terms of coordination skills and timing.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/13/upright-bass-image.jpeg\" alt=\"Upright Bass\" width=\"2268\" height=\"1479\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/13/responsive/upright-bass-image-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/13/responsive/upright-bass-image-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/13/responsive/upright-bass-image-md.jpeg 768w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/13/responsive/upright-bass-image-lg.jpeg 1024w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/13/responsive/upright-bass-image-xl.jpeg 1360w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/13/responsive/upright-bass-image-2xl.jpeg 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>An interesting scientific article came out in 2017 in the Frontiers in Human Neuroscience titled \"<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5447290/\">Music Games: potential Application and Consideration for Rhythmic Training</a>\". The research sought to find if any popular music-based games helped significantly with training rhythmic, cognitive and language skills. They covered a wide array of different music game: dancing games such as Just Dance, singing games such as Everyone Sing, various console rhythm games such as Guitar Hero and DJ Hero, and various mobile tapping rhythm games. They used the mechanism used to record the response (i.e. the guitar for Guitar Hero, the Kinect/Wii remote for Just Dance) the scoring system in their respective games, and the gameplay in their respect games to gauge if such games would have significant impact on rhythmic skill acquisition. Unfortunately, according to the data, none of the game that they studies showed any significant impact. The researchers behind this study reasoned that this is because in most of these games, are lackluster in their gameplay for fostering any significant rhythmic skill improvement, which makes sense since these games, at the end of the day, are games and are meant for enjoyment. However, despite this finding, they noted that a certain type of game they analyzed could pave the way for successful rhythmic training: mobile rhythm games. According to them, mobile rhythm games \"use tapping to the beat [and] provide the simplest solution to implement a rhythm training protocol.\" Though, they added that these games would need improvement to scoring systems to more precisely record rhythm precision.</p>\n<p>When I first saw the title of this article, I was really excited to read it. I grew up with games such as Guitar Hero, Rockband and American Idol on the Wii, so these type of music games are really dear to me. I was hoping that I'd read this article, then show it to my parents to show them that all that time I'd spent on those games in my childhood wasn't for naught and that it was actually helping me develop certain skills. Though I was a bit disappointed with the article's findings, I was happy to hear about the potential applications of mobile rhythm games. While console rhythm games characterized my childhood, I am currently a huge fan of mobile rhythm gaming and would spend much of my free time on them. Given these scientific findings, I thought that I would share two of my favorite mobile rhythm games and why I believe that they can help with \"implementing a rhythm training protocol\" as per the article. </p>\n<p>Deemo is a Taiwanese-based mobile rhythm game that was released back in 2013 by Rayark. It's gained a large following, warranting multiple remakes on newer consoles. The gameplay is fairly simple and reminiscent of a piano: there is a single line at the bottom of the screen with notes that will come down in accordance to the song you choose, you have to tap the notes as they hit the black line, which aligns with the song. There are two difficulties: easy and hard. Most of the music featured in this game is orchestra and piano-based pieces, so if that's your forte I'd recommend this game. Why I believe it would help with improving rhythm training is because the scoring system is much more accurate than most games, which was a main criticism from the article. While the game has a \"perfect\" designation for when notes are tapped at the correct time, there are two types of \"perfect\" designations: a normal perfect and a charming perfect. A charming perfect is shown by a yellow flash when the note is tapped while a normal perfect is shown by a green flash. A charming perfect is a more accurate \"perfect\" designation, which attributes to a more precise scoring system, a system scored out of 100%. For instance, a song completed with all perfect taps nets a \"Full Combo\" score, however, a song completed with all charming perfect taps nets an \"All Charming\" score, which is accompanied with a 100% (a full combo will not net a 100%).</p>\n<p><strong>Cytus &amp; Cytus II</strong></p>\n<p>Cytus and Cytus II are a pair of Taiwanese-based mobile rhythm games released by Rayark. Compared to Deemo, the gameplay is much more intricate and can be a bit confusing. The premise of the game is the same as Deemo in principal: notes will appear in accordance with a song and you have to tap the notes accordingly on a single line. However, the main gameplay mechanic that differs is that in Cytus, the notes are stationary and the line moves up and down. I believe that because of this main difference, Cytus is a little more difficult to grasps than Deemo, though it would make for more significant improvement in rhythmic skills. At each point the line is moving in the opposite direction, new notes will appear on the screen; notes are designated by a specific color based on which direction it is meant to be tapped (as to avoid further confusion in conjunction with other notes). This game enjoys a mixed variety of music from electronic music to piano and orchestra based pieces. And much like Deemo, the scoring system is quite precise. There are two different \"perfect\" designations with one being more accurate than the other, with the more accurate perfect being shown with a bold \"perfect\" showing up on the screen when a note is tapped while a normal perfect is shown with a regular-font \"perfect\". Songs are scored out of 1,000,000, all accurate \"perfects\" will net a \"Million Master\" score along with a 1,000,000 while all normal \"perfects\" will net only a \"full combo\" score (a full combo with not net a 1,000,000).</p>\n<div> </div>\n<div class=\"separator\">I highly recommend both of these games, I've spent a lot of time playing them and I've gotten quite good. I also believe that it's improved my rhythmic skills, especially when it comes to my vocal performance skills and instrumental skills. Both of these games are not too expensive and can be found on the App Store and Google Play Store. I hope that those of you who choose to check these games out get as much fun out of them as I have!</div>",

However, this month houses room for many celebrations, including International Guitar Appreciation Month. When we think of Jazz most think of the saxophone, trumpet, and trombone; but what about the even popular string instrument, the guitar? One of Jazz' most prominent guitarists came from Indianapolis, Indiana, Wes Montgomery. </p>\n<div>\n<h3>Early Life</h3>\nWes Montgomery came from a large, musical family, and early on his parents split apart. Wes moved with his father and siblings to Ohio, where life was a lot harder with less income to rely on. His older brother, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk_Montgomery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Monk</a>, actually dropped out of school to make money, and he ended up buying Wes his first guitar with his savings. The four-string guitar was from a pawn shop, and Wes spent a lot of time getting to know the instrument before moving onto the six-string guitar. <br>\n<h3>Musical Talent</h3>\n</div>\n<div>Wes Montgomery was most famously known for playing without a pick, instead using his thumb. This gave him an unusual sound for his time, attracting listeners to his revolutionary methods. The story behind the technique is an odd and admirable one. By playing with his thumb, the instrument was much quieter than it would be when using a pick; this kept the noise down and kept his neighbors happy. Who knew Wes' people-pleasing way would become his signature? \n<div>Montgomery is entirely self-taught and couldn't read music. Talk about inspiration for new coming players! Wes was a family man and did everything he could to provide for his wife and children. He worked full-time at an electronics factory in the morning to afternoon, took a small break, and went straight into gigs and production sessions. <br><br></div>\n<div>Take a listen and watch this live performance of Montgomery from 1965, just three years before his untimely death at age 45. His passion for music and his musical companions can not only be heard in his music, but also in his words and actions. \n<h3>Awards and Recognitions</h3>\n<div>Wes Montgomery has numerous awards and nominations to his name. This includes 2 <a href=\"https://www.grammy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Grammys </a>out of 5 nominations, Best Jazz Guitarist by <a href=\"https://www.downbeat.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DownBeat </a>(a whopping 6 times), and Most Promising Jazz Instrumentalist by <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Billboard</a>. <br><br></div>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MOm17yw__6U\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div><br>\n<div><br>Wes Montgomery was a hardworking man that left lasting impressions on the jazz world from his 21 years of music production. They are impressions that seem to be lasting a lifetime for the genre, and for good reason. It pays off to find the way to play that works for you; you never know when it could be something you're known for forever. </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><br>\n<h3>Sources:</h3>\n<div><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Montgomery\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Montgomery</a></div>\n<div><br><a href=\"https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-04-26/what-made-wes-montgomery-legend\">https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-04-26/what-made-wes-montgomery-legend<br><br>https://www.jazzwise.com/features/article/wes-montgomery-the-full-monty<br><br>https://www.discogs.com/artist/129805-Wes-Montgomery<br></a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Music dates back to ancient times, and it's only taking up a larger portion of our lives as centuries pass. With musical acts getting larger than life, the growth of accessibility to music for the hearing impaired hasn't quite taken the turn one would expect. <br><br>One thing that hit me especially hard this year was watching the Superbowl Half-Time Show with The Weeknd performing his top hits on one of the world's biggest stages.

The two have experience in making, and remaking, music videos that focus on connecting movement to music. It's not just dancing, they're visibly acting out and <i>feeling </i>the music. </p>\n<p>The duo is working on a ten part series of <a href=\"https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/american-sign-language\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American Sign Language</a> (ASL) covers of seminal works by black women. These music videos are signed, acted out, and danced to show the perfect rhythm that is the song. So many times hearing people forget that music is more than just words to the hearing impaired. Deafness can come later in life to some, which puts a lot of deaf people on the planet who very well know that emotion is fundamental to music and song understanding. </p>\n<p>While the project hasn't been released for me to share with you, here is a great example of  the power an ASL music video; done by Kazen-Maddox.</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PQfjiodBTpw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Here is another example, from Primeaux-O'Bryant. </p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0nOpDVm4MRw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>It's clear that the duo will make great art and videos together.
