            "content_html": "<p>As you know from our recent blog posts, the month of April is Jazz Appreciation Month. However, this month houses room for many celebrations, including International Guitar Appreciation Month. When we think of Jazz most think of the saxophone, trumpet, and trombone; but what about the even popular string instrument, the guitar? One of Jazz' most prominent guitarists came from Indianapolis, Indiana, Wes Montgomery. </p>\n<div>\n<h3>Early Life</h3>\nWes Montgomery came from a large, musical family, and early on his parents split apart. Wes moved with his father and siblings to Ohio, where life was a lot harder with less income to rely on. His older brother, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk_Montgomery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Monk</a>, actually dropped out of school to make money, and he ended up buying Wes his first guitar with his savings. The four-string guitar was from a pawn shop, and Wes spent a lot of time getting to know the instrument before moving onto the six-string guitar. <br>\n<h3>Musical Talent</h3>\n</div>\n<div>Wes Montgomery was most famously known for playing without a pick, instead using his thumb. This gave him an unusual sound for his time, attracting listeners to his revolutionary methods. The story behind the technique is an odd and admirable one. By playing with his thumb, the instrument was much quieter than it would be when using a pick; this kept the noise down and kept his neighbors happy. Who knew Wes' people-pleasing way would become his signature? \n<div>Montgomery is entirely self-taught and couldn't read music. Talk about inspiration for new coming players! Wes was a family man and did everything he could to provide for his wife and children. He worked full-time at an electronics factory in the morning to afternoon, took a small break, and went straight into gigs and production sessions. <br><br></div>\n<div>Take a listen and watch this live performance of Montgomery from 1965, just three years before his untimely death at age 45. His passion for music and his musical companions can not only be heard in his music, but also in his words and actions. \n<h3>Awards and Recognitions</h3>\n<div>Wes Montgomery has numerous awards and nominations to his name. This includes 2 <a href=\"https://www.grammy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Grammys </a>out of 5 nominations, Best Jazz Guitarist by <a href=\"https://www.downbeat.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DownBeat </a>(a whopping 6 times), and Most Promising Jazz Instrumentalist by <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Billboard</a>. <br><br></div>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MOm17yw__6U\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div><br>\n<div><br>Wes Montgomery was a hardworking man that left lasting impressions on the jazz world from his 21 years of music production. They are impressions that seem to be lasting a lifetime for the genre, and for good reason. It pays off to find the way to play that works for you; you never know when it could be something you're known for forever. </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><br>\n<h3>Sources:</h3>\n<div><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Montgomery\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Montgomery</a></div>\n<div><br><a href=\"https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-04-26/what-made-wes-montgomery-legend\">https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-04-26/what-made-wes-montgomery-legend<br><br>https://www.jazzwise.com/features/article/wes-montgomery-the-full-monty<br><br>https://www.discogs.com/artist/129805-Wes-Montgomery<br></a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

            "content_html": "<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.who.int/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The World Health Organization</a>, over 430 million people suffer from some form of hearing loss. That leaves a huge majority of the world's population without issues, which is made clear in mainstream media. Individuals with hearing loss, or complete loss, have very little outlets to turn to that cater to their needs. Interpreters can be costly for individuals, especially when 80% of those suffering from disability hearing loss come from middle to low-income backgrounds.</p>\n<h3>The Impact of Music</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Music is one of, if not <i>the</i>, most important creative outlets for humans. Music dates back to ancient times, and it's only taking up a larger portion of our lives as centuries pass. With musical acts getting larger than life, the growth of accessibility to music for the hearing impaired hasn't quite taken the turn one would expect. <br><br>One thing that hit me especially hard this year was watching the Superbowl Half-Time Show with The Weeknd performing his top hits on one of the world's biggest stages. The movements from the R&amp;B singer and his dancers were chaotic and mesmerizing when paired with his songs. But it made me wonder how interesting the show would be if I couldn't hear the music, I would be staring into chaos without that binding agent that is music.</p>\n<h3>Sign Language Music Videos</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In a new project dedicated to making music more accessible to the hearing impaired, deaf actor and dancer <a href=\"https://www.mervinprimeauxobryant.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mervin Primeaux-O'Bryant</a> and hearing dancer and choreographer <a href=\"https://www.brandonkazen-maddox.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brandon Kazen-Maddox</a> are revolutionizing music videos. The two have experience in making, and remaking, music videos that focus on connecting movement to music. It's not just dancing, they're visibly acting out and <i>feeling </i>the music. </p>\n<p>The duo is working on a ten part series of <a href=\"https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/american-sign-language\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American Sign Language</a> (ASL) covers of seminal works by black women. These music videos are signed, acted out, and danced to show the perfect rhythm that is the song. So many times hearing people forget that music is more than just words to the hearing impaired. Deafness can come later in life to some, which puts a lot of deaf people on the planet who very well know that emotion is fundamental to music and song understanding. </p>\n<p>While the project hasn't been released for me to share with you, here is a great example of  the power an ASL music video; done by Kazen-Maddox.</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PQfjiodBTpw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Here is another example, from Primeaux-O'Bryant. </p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0nOpDVm4MRw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>It's clear that the duo will make great art and videos together. This is a huge step for the hearing disabled community. The gap that Mervin and Brandon are attempting to bridge is one that would allow for deaf, or partially deaf, community members to enjoy music for the first time in years, or for the first time ever. <br><br>Keep in touch with the new project; you can find the original article from The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/arts/music/asl-music-deaf-culture.html#:~:text=Their%20version%20of%20%E2%80%9CMidnight%20Train,Broadstream%2C%20an%20arts%20streaming%20platform.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Sources:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/arts/music/asl-music-deaf-culture.html#:~:text=Their%20version%20of%20%E2%80%9CMidnight%20Train,Broadstream%2C%20an%20arts%20streaming%20platform.\">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/arts/music/asl-music-deaf-culture.html#:~:text=Their%20version%20of%20%E2%80%9CMidnight%20Train,Broadstream%2C%20an%20arts%20streaming%20platform.</a><br><br><a href=\"https://www.mervinprimeauxobryant.com/\">https://www.mervinprimeauxobryant.com/<br></a><br><a href=\"https://www.brandonkazen-maddox.com/\">https://www.brandonkazen-maddox.com/</a><br><br><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/deafness-and-hearing-loss#:~:text=Over%205%25%20of%20the%20world's,will%20have%20disabling%20hearing%20loss.\">https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/deafness-and-hearing-loss#:~:text=Over%205%25%20of%20the%20world's,will%20have%20disabling%20hearing%20loss.</a></p>\n<p> </p>",

The EMH suggests music is associated with colors based off a shared emotional connection. The theory is practically ingrained into children's brains while growing up. Yellow smiley face stickers encourage children to believe they just completed a task well in school, whereas red stop signs are taught to be a hard \"no\", do not continue. From a young age, the human mind is trained in this way, which then associates those colors with certain emotions; yellow now means happy, red stands for conflict and adrenaline.  <br><br>According to a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6240980/#:~:text=In%20contrast%2C%20the%20emotional%20mediation,2016%3B%20Sebba%2C%201991).\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study </a>produced by four psychology researchers, loud, fast music tends to be associated with darker, more saturated colors, such as red. On the other hand, softer, higher pitched music is read on the less saturated color spectrum, like pinks or yellows. Slower, more harmonious music is often paired with the color blue, for its calming effects on the mind.<br><br>With this newly learned information, try taking the theories to everyday life. Many advertising agencies use this color information to give products and services a better chance with consumers. And on the musical end, music videos often utilize color and emotional ties to music to capture audience attention. <br><br></div>\n<div>While this may explain a good amount for those of us living in the Western world, these theories have not been as widely tested in the Eastern world, so it is unknown if cultural difference make a difference in color to music association. <br><br><br></div>\n<div> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sevencolorsofmusic.com/Chapter2B.php\">http://www.sevencolorsofmusic.com/Chapter2B.php<br></a><br><a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/110/22/8836\">https://www.pnas.org/content/110/22/8836<br></a><br><a href=\"https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2137294\">https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2137294<br></a><br><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6240980/#:~:text=In%20contrast%2C%20the%20emotional%20mediation,2016%3B%20Sebba%2C%201991).\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6240980/#:~:text=In%20contrast%2C%20the%20emotional%20mediation,2016%3B%20Sebba%2C%201991).</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>",

To combat this, many students will try to use music as an escape from the real world so they can immerse themselves into their studies and work. Now that this metaphorical flowchart has brought us here, it's time to ask the final question: what music should you choose to keep focused? When I first tried to add music to my studying regimen, obviously I chose music that I loved to listen to, music by my favorite artists. Though, I would learn that this kind of music wouldn't be the best because I'd get caught up singing along to the lyrics and then realizing I have no idea what I've read for the last few sentences. So I began to wonder what the best genre of music for the job would be. Enter lofi music.</p>\n<p>Lofi music is an umbrella term for a type of music that is produced to mimic a lower sound quality, hence the \"lo-\" part of lofi (Lofi actually stands for low fidelity). This type of sound is characterized by a sound that contains technical flaws that make the recorded sound different from the live sound that was actually recorded. The sound could be distorted, or contain limited frequency responses. Very common characteristics in many pieces of lofi are a strong bass, simple repetitive beat that is contagious and no vocals. Based on this explanation, you might be asking yourself why exactly is this genre of music so popular? This kind of music wouldn't necessarily strike people as top-charting or even very interesting. Yet, a YouTube channel by the name of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJ4gkVC6NrvII8umztf0Ow\">ChilledCow</a> (rebranded to Lofi Girl after gaining a large following) has amassed over eight million subscribers with compilation videos of lofi music gaining upwards of 40 million views. This channel also has daily livestreams of lofi music playing constantly that tends to have thousands of people watching at a time. </p>\n<p>Well, to answer that question as to why lofi is so popular: science.</p>\n<p>According to Kevin Woods, the director of science at <a href=\"http://brain.fm/\">Brain.fm</a>, a site that offers specific focus music tailored for different people, and who has a PhD in auditory neuroscience, good focus music must have certain features. Some of these features include no vocals, simple melodies, 'dark' spectrum, dense texture, minimal salient events (sudden differing sound effects that would change the volume) and steady pulse. If you want to get more technical, some specific sound features of good focus music include sub-30-200Hz modulation and above 10-20Hz modulation. Given some of the characteristics of lofi music that I included above (and if you've checked out Lofi Girl's videos), lofi seems to fit the bill almost to a tee. The brain has the ability to easily predict how sounds will continue on a subconscious level, and when that prediction is successfully fulfilled, it can put the brain in a calming state, according to music professor Victor Szabo. Lofi utilizes the phenomenon of \"cocooning\", placing the brain into a predictable and soft environment that makes it believe that it has escaped the stresses of the real world, to help you stay relaxed and in turn, focused. According to one recent survey, 86% of lofi listeners have noticed a significant increase in their productivity compared to when they don't listen to lofi.</p>\n<p>I'll admit that even while I'm writing this post, I'm enjoying one of Lofi Girl's livestreams to help me stay focused. I've also come across some lofi music that includes soft nature sounds such as running water, rain droplets or the rustling of leaves, which I think adds to the comfort aspect of the music, as people tend to use nature sounds to relax and go to sleep. I did notice that Lofi Girl also has a lofi livestream for people trying sleep, which I might try for myself as well. For students struggling with staying consistent in their studies, or even those who are working remotely that needs something to keep them focused, I highly recommend trying lofi music. It is no wonder that lofi music has gained a huge following during the pandemic as surely people working and taking classes remotely have turned to it for help. Happy studying!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>When I was in undergraduate college at NYU, I've had the privilege of entertaining a varied course load that my school offered. Out of all of the interesting and though-provoking classes that I've taken at NYU, I'd had to say that the Intro to Music Therapy class I took in my junior year certainly takes the prize as the most interesting class I'd taken there. Before taking that class, I had no idea that music therapy was actually something that people specialized in and implemented in health institutions. I mean, I've always wondered about the healing properties of music since for example, if I was having a bad day, I could rely on putting on a song or artist that I enjoyed listening to and it would bring my mood up. Though, I never thought that the implications would be significant enough for such a practice to be warranted in actual treatment of patients. As a musician who did a cappella in college who was also studying premed, I felt that this class would cater to both of these interests. Nevertheless, I was very excited to start this course.</p>\n<p>I quickly learned that this class was not only one of the more interesting courses I'd take, but also one of the most unique. For starters, the professor was a licensed music therapist first before an NYU professor, meaning the way that he would approach the class would be much different from any typical professor I'd had before. Every class, we'd have a group of readings on the healing powers of music to prepare beforehand and then we'd discuss the findings and talk more in-depth about them as a class, which doesn't really differ much from a regular class. What made it different was that every class ended with a jam session. The room we had class in had cabinets filled with different percussion instruments, which gave each of us, ignoring individual music capabilities, the opportunity to create music together and explore the healing powers of music firsthand.<br><br></p>\n<p>All of the articles were quite eye-opening. A lot of times, simple music concepts are used and put into a clinical setting and then suddenly it takes on a completely different purpose. One great example: improvisation is a common technique used in the treatment for pain. More often than not, pain isn't voluntary; you don't control when and where you feel certain pains. This can also apply to psychological disorders such as anxiety and depressions, those who have it don't choose if and when to have episodes. What musical improvisation allows patients to do is to take control of something, as they have the power to control the tempo of their music, the direction their music takes melodically and how long it goes for. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One thing I really appreciated about the course were the assignments. My professor didn't really care for grades in the sense that as long as we put effort into our written assignments and prepared the readings for every week, we were bound to do well; he cared more about us retaining and understanding the material he was trying to teach us. The majority of our written assignments had us reflecting on how what we learned the class has made us think about the music in our everyday lives differently, if it has at all. So there were no wrong answers, as long as you provided a well-thought-out response, that was all that was required. </p>\n<p>The most profound assignment we had, in my opinion, was a short presentation we had to give on a piece of music that had significant meaning to us. I was personally surprised by the piece that I'd chosen because it came to me in a revelation I had while pondering the readings we'd done. I ended up doing a presentation on the Intermezzo movement from the Carmen Suite. The Intermezzo is essentially a woodwind quartet (piccolo, flute, clarinet, english horn) with orchestra backdrop. What made this piece so significant to me was that I had the astounding honor of performing in a youth orchestra in middle school and we had done selections from the Carmen Suite, including the Intermezzo, at Alice Tully Hall in Lincoln Center. As first chair clarinet that year, the clarinet solo portion of the Intermezzo fell upon me and along with my other first-chair woodwind musicians, we performed the Intermezzo on that beautiful stage with such grace and I still get goosebumps to this day hearing this movement because it brings me back to that stage and that moment when it was just the sound of my clarinet before the plucking of string instruments that filled the venue, even if it was just for a few seconds, I'd felt like the king of the world for just those few seconds. Flash forward many years later to my sophomore year of college, I'm far removed from my time spent in that youth orchestra; I'd even stopped seriously practicing and playing my clarinet because my busy college schedule just simply wouldn't allow for it and in all honesty, I'd chosen singing over clarinet as I pursuing a cappella in college. An old friend of mine and I decided to make a date to go to The Met and enjoy an opera. Though I was a classically trained vocalist when I was taking singing lessons in middle school and high school, operas were still a farcry from what I was familiar with, as in I could probably count the number of operas I knew on one hand. It just happened to be my lucky day that the opera set for performance on that night was Carmen, one that I was very much familiar with, but in that moment, had consciously forgotten that I knew the music since it had been a while since I'd played it. I distinctly remember immediately after an intermission, the plucking of string instruments began to play and then the emergence of a piccolo filled the vibrations of the auditorium and it all came rushing back to me. I'd been teleported back to the Alice Tully Hall stage, sitting in my tuxedo with clammy hands and ready to perform the Intermezzo. Following the piccolo, the clarinet takes over and I could subconsciously feel myself fingering the notes along with the piece as I sat in the nosebleeds. A rush of nostalgia and emotion came over me and it had almost brought me to tears as I remembered the time that I felt like I was on top of the world; a simpler time. Even as I write this recollection now, I switched over to YouTube just to listen to the Intermezzo again as emotions fill my mind. I can't believe that a single class project has had me go through a whirlwind of emotions.</p>\n<div class=\"post-body-container\">\n<div id=\"post-body-1096903584715463974\" class=\"post-body entry-content float-container\">\n<p>The culmination of our takeaways from the course came in the form of a self-proposed research paper about music therapy. As a fan of Korean pop, I decided to write my piece about the rise of Korean pop and despite fan not understanding the lyrics, why the concept of music therapy can still apply to Korean pop. Like I've covered many times here, I've stated that music is a universal language, which was the crux of my argument in my research paper (and I also had sources to support that as well).</p>\n<p>Overall, I really enjoyed my time spend in that Intro to Music Therapy course and learned a lot about not only the practice of music therapy, but also myself in the process. If anyone has the chance to take a course about it, I'd highly recommend it and hopefully the experience you have in the course will be as rewarding and enlightening as it's been for me!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<div class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<div class=\"byline post-share-buttons goog-inline-block\"> </div>\n</div>\n</div>",

There are two forms of music therapy. In one, you create music as an emotional release. In the other, you listen to music while performing a creative task. The former being the most common for children with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADHD or ADD). <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3vQKAmb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Music therapy</a> can help boost attention and focus, reduce hyperactivity, and strengthen social skills.</p>\n<p>But why does it work?</p>\n<p><strong>MUSIC PROVIDES STRUCTURE.</strong> When you have ADHD, your mind is racing at record speeds. Being so full of mental and physical energy makes it more difficult to focus for long periods of time. Music is very structured, and this is very appealing to the ADHD mind. The mind craves a sense of order and structure. </p>\n<p>Music is rhythm, rhythm is structure, and structure is soothing to an ADHD brain. Every song has a beginning, middle, and end, making it organized and predictable. The beats and rhythms also have a specific structure. This redirects and refocuses the mind, encouraging better mental organization.</p>\n<p><strong>MUSIC RELEASES DOPAMINE.</strong> A mind with ADHD has lower levels of dopamine – the neurotransmitter responsible for motivation, attention, working memory, and focus. Research shows that pleasurable music increases dopamine levels in the brain. “Music activates both sides of the brain, forcing your whole brain to work together and build new neural networks.” says Jessica Camino, a neurologic music therapist in Los Angeles. “Through brain imaging, we can see how music lights up the left and right lobes.”</p>\n<h2>Turn Off the TV</h2>\n<p>The mind of kids with ADHD jumps around to everything, making them more sensitive to auditory stimulation and less able to tune things out, like television. Replace the mindless chatter of <em>Spongebob</em> with the calming rhythms of music. Play some classical music while you brush teeth, smooth jazz as you make breakfast, and some blues as you clean the house. These small changes will already make a huge change in your child's brain.</p>\n<h2>How to Get Started?</h2>\n<p>If you want to start your child on music lessons and see the changes music can make, the process is surprisingly simple. </p>\n<p>1. Sit down with your child and pick out the instrument that they are most excited to learn. (remember voice is an instrument as well!) or <a href=\"https://musicsol.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contact us</a> for a FREE consultation where we'll help you pick out the perfect instrument! </p>\n<p>2. <a href=\"https://musicsol.net/offer?f=ADHD-Music-Education\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign up</a> Risk Free today!

god of music - didn’t punish Hermes for stealing cattle from him, but instead traded his cattle for the lyre (Awana).  Similar stories were told in relation to Hermes’ son Pan for creating the panpipe, and Athena for inventing the flute.  The oldest surviving musical instrument was the auloi, which was made of bone and dates back to the Neolithic Age.  During the Bronze Age there were marble sculptures of people playing instruments, as well as hieroglyphic script of musical instruments.  Although the auloi is the oldest noted instrument, the Greeks considered it more of a competitor - as this was the instrument used to challenge Apollo to a musical competition, and so the lyre was a ‘real’ Greek instrument (Cartwright).</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/4/calligraphy-g93c3381e8_1920.jpeg\" alt=\"medieval music notation\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1334\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/4/responsive/calligraphy-g93c3381e8_1920-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/4/responsive/calligraphy-g93c3381e8_1920-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/4/responsive/calligraphy-g93c3381e8_1920-md.jpeg 768w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/4/responsive/calligraphy-g93c3381e8_1920-lg.jpeg 1024w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/4/responsive/calligraphy-g93c3381e8_1920-xl.jpeg 1360w ,https://hex20dec.github.io/musicmi-blog/media/posts/4/responsive/calligraphy-g93c3381e8_1920-2xl.jpeg 1600w\"></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The study of music theory was also dated back to as early as the 6th century BCE.  The earliest surviving text was the Harmonic Elements by Aristoxenus which was written in the 4th century BCE.  The study of music theory consisted mostly of philosophy and the “mathematical expression of the cosmic order,” (Cartwright).  As music was greatly related to philosophy, it was believed that<i> peaceful and calming music had the power to heal both the body and mind.  </i>Therefore, philosopher Plato banned instruments that were able to create fast beats and tempos, and over complicated rhythms.  As soft music was able to strengthen and cleanse the body and soul, it was believed that music of intensity was morally dangerous and could have harmful effects.  </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The celebratory ceremonies that always incorporated music were mostly either religious or pleasure based.  Religious practices were usually accompanied by music, such as the sacrifices to the gods.  The Great Dionysia festivals included prayers and hymns which were sung throughout by the chorus groups and professional musicians.  Music, dance, poetry and theater were also very competitive activities because excelling in these art forms was an honor to the gods.  The earliest noted musical competitions were in Sparta, Argos and Paros which are dated back to 7th century BCE.  Lastly, music was such an integral part of Greek life that men would sing both during their meals and on their way home, while women would play instruments and write poetry in their homes (Cartwright).  </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The importance of music to ancient Greeks went way beyond entertainment, as the bond it created to the gods and within one's body was of high standard and belief.  From the very creation of music, to the way it was used - it always related back to the gods.  For the Greeks to view music as something so godlike only proves how greatly they appreciated this in their lives.</p>\n<p>It should also be a lesson for people today, to understand the power that music has, and the healing energy that can be created. </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Who knew that playing an instrument could be seen as godlike…</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Works Cited: </p>\n<p>Awana, Momi.  “Instruments Used in Greek Mythology.” <i>Heremes’ Lyre. </i>2014.  Web.</p>\n<p>Cartwright, Mark. “Ancient Greek Music.” <i>Musical Origins.  </i>2013.  Web. </p>",

            "content_html": "<p><strong>The Benefits of Online Learning: 7 Reasons Why It's Better Than Traditional School</strong></p>\n<p>Times have changed and learning is not confined to books, lectures, or classrooms anymore. In today’s digital world, knowledge can be accessed at the click of a button. Thanks to so many advanced online learning platforms, people can now access information from the comfort of their own home. These online education platforms are a great way for students to learn new skills without having to leave their homes and has many benefits over traditional schooling. In this article we will take a look at eight reasons why online learning is better than traditional schooling.</p>\n<h2>1. You can learn at your own pace</h2>\n<p>In traditional schooling, students are expected to keep the same pace with their fellow classmates. That way, everyone can be taught on the same level at all times, regardless of the individual students learning needs. The problem with this is that it delays students who are ahead of the game, or hinders the learning process for those who need more time to grasp a certain skill or concept. With online learning, every student is catered to their own pace and there is no one to keep up with, making students feel more comfortable to focus on learning instead of having to keep up with everyone else. This is especially beneficial for those who are taking online courses as a supplement to their traditional schooling.</p>\n<h2>2. It’s more affordable than traditional schooling</h2>\n<p>The system that is currently set in place for schooling is quite expensive. Students may have to purchase books and supplies for each class, pay for transportation, and also have to pay extra to dorm while attending school. On the other hand, with online learning, there is no need to worry about spending money on textbooks, transportation, or having to relocate. All the materials needed to learn a subject are available online, and can be accessed from the comfort of their own home. Even better, some online education platforms even offer free courses. So, no matter what course a student is interested in taking, they can do so at a low cost or no cost. Sounds like a win win situation.</p>\n<h2>3. You can learn from the best scholars and teachers without moving</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, in order to get access to the best teachers, people often have to move to a new region or city, and in some cases, even leave the country. This can be challenging for those who have family or work commitments that are in their current state of residence. On the bright side, online learning does not require a complete change in prior commitments as students can learn from the best scholars and professors without having to move. This is especially beneficial for individuals who want to learn a new skill but don’t want to change their living or work situation.</p>\n<h2>4. You can access your lessons anytime, anywhere!</h2>\n<div class=\"post-body-container\">\n<div id=\"post-body-1201010591928639276\" class=\"post-body entry-content float-container\">\n<p>Schooling nowadays requires students to be at a certain location at a certain time in order to learn. If a class is missed for any reason, students may have to miss out on important information. On the other hand, with online learning, students don’t have a specific time or place to be. They can access their online course from any device at any time of the day. This makes online learning accessible to people who live in remote areas or who have other obligations that keep them from being at a certain place at a certain time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>5. It’s easy to find a course that meets your needs and skillset</h2>\n<p>It is very common that in most schools students are required to take classes in subjects they do not care about. This is because a school has a certain curriculum that all students have to follow. While this makes the school more diverse, it can be frustrating for students who don’t want to take certain courses. On the other hand, with online courses, students can find a course that matches their specific needs and skillset with the bonus of these courses often run by experts in the field, meaning that it allows students to receive the best quality education possible. This is great for those who want to learn a specific skill, but don’t want to take general courses.</p>\n<h2>6. You can collaborate with other learners and professors</h2>\n<p>Another benefit of online learning is the helpful online community available! If a student ever gets stuck on a certain concept or skill, they can reach out to other students who are taking the same course - and often times this can be students from all over the world. Also, collaborating with other students and professors is very easy through the many online learning platforms that allow students to communicate with others through discussion boards and live chats at any given time!</p>\n<h2>7. It empowers you to be more independent</h2>\n<p>Traditional schooling often requires students to attend class with other classmates. While this can be helpful for some, it can also be limiting for others. Online learning empowers students to be more independent since they can learn from the comfort of their own home without having to worry about speaking up in class or seeking help from a classmate. Online learning is convenient for anyone, whether they want to learn a new skill on the side, or if they want to completely change their career. There are online courses available for all skill levels, from beginners to experts. People can search for an online course that interests them and is within their skill level. From there, it is just the matter of choosing a virtual school that offers the course desired. Online learning allows students to take control of their education and meet career goals faster and they can do it any time and anywhere.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<div class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<div class=\"byline post-share-buttons goog-inline-block\"> </div>\n</div>\n</div>",
