By the early 18th century enthusiasm in Western Europe for coffee amongst the middle classes had spread and was beginning to affect Prussia's economy. Frederick the Great, the country's monarch, attempted to block imports of green coffee as Prussia's wealth was being drained by this new craze. He restricted the right to sell coffee to four distillers but the coffee drinking trend has become so widespread that the law was being overlooked and coffee beans were illegally roasted all over the country.</div><div> </div><div><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/37/pexels-pixabay-161039.jpeg" alt="small austrian village" width="3672" height="2458" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/37/responsive/pexels-pixabay-161039-xs.jpeg 300w, https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/37/responsive/pexels-pixabay-161039-sm.jpeg 480w, https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/37/responsive/pexels-pixabay-161039-md.jpeg 768w, https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/37/responsive/pexels-pixabay-161039-lg.jpeg 1024w, https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/37/responsive/pexels-pixabay-161039-xl.jpeg 1360w, https://articles.musicmi.org/media/posts/37/responsive/pexels-pixabay-161039-2xl.jpeg 1600w"></figure></div><div class="inner"><br>The Prussian king condemned the increase in coffee consumption as "disgusting" and urged his subjects to drink beer instead. The King even employed <em>coffee smellers</em>, who stalked the streets sniffing for the outlawed smell of fresh roasted coffee beans. However the public was so upset by this whole situation that eventually he was forced to change his mind.</div><div> </div><div class="inner">As a satire on this whole affair, Bach wrote the "Coffee Cantata," a humorous one act operetta about a stern father's attempt to check his daughter's indulgence in the much loved Saxon habit of coffee drinking.</div><p>"If I couldn't three times a day, be allowed to drink my little cup of coffee, in my anguish, I will turn into a shriveled-up roast goat. ... Ah! How sweet coffee tastes, more delicious than a thousand kisses, milder than muscatel wine." Is the start to Bach's Schweigt stille, plaudert nicht (“Be Still, Stop Chattering”), commonly called the Coffee Cantata, a light-hearted operetta about the struggles of parenting and how a father, Schlendrian, tries to save his daughter Liesgen from her own lusts. When we listen to the Cantata today it today, it depicts how greatly people once feared coffee! During the coffee ban, rumors were spread about the negative affects of our beloved beverage claiming it was a <strong>devilish drink unfit for children, women, and men concerned about their virility.</strong> </p><p> </p><p>Melanie King, author of <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3X3Qe0w">Tea, Coffee &amp; Chocolate: How We Fell in Love with Caffeine</a></em>, said, "Early critics of coffee felt that Englishmen [particularly] were too prone to copying the Turks, whom they thought originated coffee. Coffee was described as a 'mere decoction of the Devil' and supposedly tasted like the 'syrrop of soot' or the 'essence of old shoes'."</p><div class="AdWrapper-fFnhsA kzbamD ad giibfe"><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--in-content" data-node-id="65g5t4"><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-in-content-0" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-in-content cns-ads-slot-type-in-content-0" data-name="in_content_0" data-slot-type="in_content"><div id="in_content_0" class="cns-ads-container" data-node-id="65g5t4"></div></div></div></div><p>It didn’t help that in that time coffeehouses were a rowdy place. Musicians played music and partied, men and women mingled freely without chaperones, people told dirty jokes, and, if rumors are true, political plots were born.</p><p>So, in the eyes of Bach's father character, Schlendrian, coffee was not the beverage for a good girl, and coffeehouses were no place for respectable women. In 17th-century England, women were often barred from entry. </p><p>Schlendrian pulls out all his cards in an effort to make Liesgen give up her coffee habit. He tries to ground Liesgen though it does not work, telling her she’s banned from attending weddings and parties. He claims he will stop buying her dresses and bonnets. Liesgen, though, remains unfazed. But then he ups the stakes: Until she gives up coffee, there will be no husband!</p><p>Take a listen to the Coffee Cantata <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6Loyexw3uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to find out if Liesgen gets her way or if her father stops her coffee shenanigans. </p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B6Loyexw3uk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div><p>You can get your copy of the score for the Coffee Cantata <a href="https://amzn.to/3XUBF0n">here</a>.</p><figure class="post__image"><a href="https://amzn.to/3XUBF0n" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="file:///Users/yasmin/Documents/Publii/sites/musicmi-news/input/media/posts/36/31T4RVUmmL._SX348_BO1204203200_.jpg" alt="" width="305" height="396" sizes="100vw" srcset="file:///Users/yasmin/Documents/Publii/sites/musicmi-news/input/media/posts/36/responsive/31T4RVUmmL._SX348_BO1204203200_-xs.jpg 300w, file:///Users/yasmin/Documents/Publii/sites/musicmi-news/input/media/posts/36/responsive/31T4RVUmmL._SX348_BO1204203200_-sm.jpg 480w, file:///Users/yasmin/Documents/Publii/sites/musicmi-news/input/media/posts/36/responsive/31T4RVUmmL._SX348_BO1204203200_-md.jpg 768w, file:///Users/yasmin/Documents/Publii/sites/musicmi-news/input/media/posts/36/responsive/31T4RVUmmL._SX348_BO1204203200_-lg.jpg 1024w, file:///Users/yasmin/Documents/Publii/sites/musicmi-news/input/media/posts/36/responsive/31T4RVUmmL._SX348_BO1204203200_-xl.jpg 1360w, file:///Users/yasmin/Documents/Publii/sites/musicmi-news/input/media/posts/36/responsive/31T4RVUmmL._SX348_BO1204203200_-2xl.jpg 1600w"></a></figure><p></p><p>We definitely have to agree with Liesgen on this one!
